        programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation
        of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Here
        are some key characteristics of functional programming:\\n\\n1. **First-class
        and Higher-order Functions**: In functional programming, functions are treated
        as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned
        as values, and assigned to variables. Higher-order functions are functions
        that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.\\n\\n2.
        **Pure Functions**: Pure functions are functions that always produce the same
        output for the same input and have no side effects (they don't change any
        external state). This makes them easier to reason about, test, and debug.\\n\\n3.
        **Immutability**: Functional programming often emphasizes immutability, meaning
        data cannot be changed after it's created. This helps avoid side effects and
        makes code easier to understand and reason about.\\n\\n4. **Recursion**: Functional
        programming often uses recursion instead of loops to repeat operations.\\n\\n5.
        **Function Composition**: Functions can be composed together to create new
        functions. This is often done using the pipe (|>) operator or similar constructs.\\n\\nHere's
        a simple example in JavaScript, a language that supports functional programming:\\n\\n```javascript\\n//
        A pure function that adds two numbers\\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b;\\n\\n//
        Using function composition to create a new function that adds 2 to the result
        of add\\nconst addTwo = compose(add, (x) => x + 2);\\n\\n// Using recursion
        to count down from a number\\nconst countDown = (n) => (n === 0 ? [] : [n
        - 1, ...countDown(n - 1)]);\\n\\n// Using recursion to calculate the factorial
        of a number\\nconst factorial = (n) => (n === 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1));\\n```\\n\\nSome
        popular functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, Clojure, and
        Scala. Many modern languages also support functional programming to some extent,
        like JavaScript, Python, and Swift.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10,\"completion_tokens\":413,\"total_tokens\":423,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}"
