        (test-driven development, TDD) What is the main function? What are the benefits?\\nTest-driven
        development (TDD-test-driven development) is mainly:\\n  1. Development (coding)
        is based on the final requirements (test result). Test First - .\\n  2. Feedback
        (REF) is fast every time. automated testing .\\n  3. The number of tests increases
        (The number of tests twice the number of functions should be written in. )
        tests .\\nSelection of TDD Key Factors:\\n  1. Refactoring First write some
        code and then use infinite test cases for automatic testing.\\n  2. Test Twice
        Completely cover the ability of the tester (the number of test cases)\\n  3.
        Design Development Program Design First meet the refactoring requirements
        and then meet the test requirements. (agile programming)\\nThe design is based
        on subtle or manual simulation, and the tested design will be more practical
        next time.\\nUsers and developers are involved in the development together
        to ensure feasibility.\\n  4. Choose the Acceptance Test (see section 2 to
        section 4 for details).\\n  5. Automated testing (see section 5 for details
        ).\\n  6. Test tool (see section 6 for details )\\nWhat does Restful mean?
        How is Restful used?\\nsimple set of rule , but as a whole is a set of strong
        coherence.\\n(1) Representation(readable text document);\\n(2) State Transfer(transfer
        information state);\\n(3) architecture is clear, providing web service interfaces
        (A new set of architecture based on HTTP);\\nFamily Style.\\nRest = HTTP interface\\n
        \ 1. For the Client, he only knows the services that should be requested based
        on the URL path specified by the server. => Filter through HTTP + map tags\\n
        \ 2. The content transmitted by the client is a defined XML or JSon format\\nWhat
        is NoSQL? What are the benefits of NoSQL?\\nNoSQL Database ,\\nCommon relational
        database:\\n  1. Standardized data storage mode (title, content, ID, and time)
        are determined when the database is created, including the data type, title,
        and Attributes of each field)\\n  2. The source of data objects is mainly
        bound to a fixed folder for query operations.\\n  3. Implementation of unified
        query language-Structured Query Language (SQL)\\nIn the search engine, however,
        even the inverted index is not suitable for the database (large amount of
        data, slowly retrieving ).\\nTherefore, the database is only suitable for
        traditional companies.\\n  2. The amount of data is particularly large\\n
        \ 3. The user expands quickly.\\n  4. The day of paralysis of the database
        is within a week (structured storage) and user growth increases non-linearly.\\nPrinciples
        for using relational databases:\\n  1. Select a small amount of data in the
        order of ten million in progress (1: n complex condition proportions)\\n  2.
        Structured data definition (business design must be clear)\\nAnother thought
        is unstructured.\\nThere should be no irrelevant configurations and no configuration
        (without Document) in the traditional NoSQL database!\\nThe technical background
        of the non-relational database is as follows:\\n  1. Relational database can
        be used in almost all systems;\\n  2. Data extraction algorithm is used to
        abstract key-value pairs;\\n  3. File storage technology.\\nThe endless expansion
        of conventional RDB is solved. The limitation of server Co-location is solved.\\nTherefore,
        the inevitable result is the distributed storage of data on multiple machines,
        while consistency and scalability (real-time performance) cannot be achieved.
        In conclusion,\\n  1. SQL functions are mandatory. One SQL can be placed in
        multiple servers, while in NoSQL, the data sources are separated and the query
        is written. (some of the immediately available values must be Fault tolerant)\\n
        \ 2. The order in the database is keywords and values. At the beginning, you
        do not define the exclusive columns, which are complex values that can accept
        the data type (similar to object storage)\\n  3. Conduct deep design at the
        business level (Koi-Vue storage)\\nTargeted Function Flow:\\n  1. Define data
        types based on specific content.\\n  2. Set the column data retrieval and
        query features in the business.\\n  3. Sets the reference for data writing.\\nThe
        final highlight is that both the database value and database extraction can
        be implemented.\\nTo solve the performance bottleneck, you can:\\n  1. Upgrade
        database hardware;\\n  2. Stand-alone optimization;\\n  3. Data retrieval
        algorithm;\\n  4. SQL optimization 3. There is only one key-value pair, which
        also faults the server.\\n  5. Establish a data warehouse and then conduct
        real-time optimization to search for database instances.\\n  6. Use parallelization
        solutions to resolve bottlenecks.\\n  7. SQL + Non-SQL solution for distributed
        databases Final optimization solution. hbase\\nWhat is the Object-oriented
        interior (also know as inside), and Reflection\\nObject-oriented interior

        Procedure and components.\\nCommon reflective languages :\\nThe essence is
        to use the object type to manipulate the object (Id ID).\\nhow to understand
        Shared and Exclusive Locks, and Optimism and Pessimism\\nNote The purpose
        of using a lock is to assert a composite physical station commitment. (transaction
        support, process locking) Implement\\n1. Exclusive/Shared\\n2. Mutual\\n  1.
        If the transaction T1 has a lock on the data object O, T2 applies to lock
        the same image O, and it is likely to cause the insecurity (strong or weak
        attributes) of the DBMS to be inconsistent.\\n3. Deadlock\\n  1. Suppose T1
        has a lock on a Data Object O1 and tries to obtain a lock on O2.\\n  2. T2
        locks an object O2 at the same time and tries to lock O1 .\\n  3. The two
        transactions wait for each other and form a cyclic wait, which is a so-called
        deadlock.\\nConclusion: data cannot be written at the same time during concurrent
        operations.\\n(Controversial data types:\\nCharacter Data: text, varchar,
        bitmap)\\nLarge Input: consumer must apply for IO, (distributed multithreading,
        CPU, I/O, virtual machine, etc)\\nThe emergence of dynamic websites greatly
        improved the time for data interaction. (IOS).\\nDefine a term for data access:

        provided by the tester, Or select other data sources based on the data source.
        Do not modify the user-provided server. Multi-server ) depends on consistency.\\nA
        data source must be shared by multiple users and no shared lock is required.\\nShared
        lock (Shared Lock: Shared Lock ): the lock can be shared by other users (that
        is, whoever has the lock can access it)\\nExclusive Lock: for other users,
        users use specified declaration and control authority to determine whether
        the data is available or not at will! (Status lock, if the user directly reads
        the file without compilation, if writing is connected to the lock, But the
        user can save the file and release the exclusive lock)\\nA should be X (with
        a return value, you need to release the lock first), B should be U (if the
        lock trigger needs to be used, and the lock disappears automatically)\\nThe
        mapping to the lock attribute design processing: (properties -> processes)\\n
        \ 1. Lock Expanding (Expand Locks) (Autolock, Users S) -> (Comprehensive lock
        set , + long time , + Association lock Ability )\\n  2. Lock (Shrink Locks)
        (Dependency set, triggerbase, action set for Users X) -> (lock set , + short
        time , + query set )\\nSummary: unlike read lock and write lock, there is
        no lock support in the system. The two are mainly for applications in different
        fields.\\nWhat is the Cache(Memcache, EhcacheWebpackPlugin, OS cache, etc.)
        application Scope and Principle?\\nCache is a medium for storing memory and
        hard disks in a computing environment. After the cache is applied, the application
        significantly improves performance. However, the data in the cache is not
        persistent.\\nPrinciple : The cache stores the publicly accessible object
        content. The bandwidth demand for new users is unlimited and staged. Load
        the page data based on the URL (confirm user identity authentication to prevent
        hackers)\\n1. P todd\\n2. Distributed cluster\\n3. Data Sharing Session and

        and oneshot/Vertical Search/Nevigation)\\nThe unique growth is the Key Algorithms
        of the web page.\\n-Bidirectional, it is more difficult to organize and design,
        the page arrangement direction is basically the same, but the webpage is fast\\nChange
        based on point reading to extract Mind Maps. Mind Map thoughts, which are
        more suitable for job usage\\nTherefore, the recommended solution is to use
        both browsers.\\nSummary: both content retrieval and search engines have been
