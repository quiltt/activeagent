        is an open-source query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those
        queries with data. It was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before
        being open-sourced in 2015. Here are some key features and concepts of GraphQL:\\n\\n1.
        **Strongly Typed**: GraphQL is self-documenting and strongly typed. It allows
        clients to define the structure of the data they need, reducing over-fetching
        and under-fetching of data.\\n\\n2. **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST APIs
        that have multiple endpoints, GraphQL has a single endpoint. The client specifies
        exactly what data it needs, reducing the number of requests and improving
        performance.\\n\\n3. **Real-time Updates**: GraphQL can be extended with real-time
        updates using technologies like GraphQL Subscriptions, allowing clients to
        react to changes in data.\\n\\n4. **Schema Stitching**: GraphQL allows you
        to combine multiple GraphQL schemas into one, making it easy to build a single
        GraphQL API from multiple services.\\n\\n5. **Introspection and Self-Documenting**:
        GraphQL APIs are self-documenting. Clients can discover the available types
        and fields in the schema, and even generate code based on that schema.\\n\\nHere's
        a simple example of a GraphQL query:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery {\\n  hero {\\n
        \   name\\n    primaryFunction\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd a GraphQL schema:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype
        Query {\\n  hero: Character\\n}\\n\\ntype Character {\\n  name: String\\n
        \ primaryFunction: String\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the client is asking
        for the `name` and `primaryFunction` of the `hero` character.\\n\\nGraphQL
        is used by many popular companies like Facebook, GitHub, and Airbnb, among
        others. It's often used as an alternative or complement to REST APIs.\\n\\nFor
