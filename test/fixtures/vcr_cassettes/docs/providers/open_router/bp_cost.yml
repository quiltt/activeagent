        is an open-source query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those
        queries with your data. It was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before
        being open-sourced in 2015. Here are some key features and concepts of GraphQL:\\n\\n1.
        **Strongly Typed**: GraphQL is self-documenting and strongly typed. It allows
        both the client and the server to agree on the structure of the data, making
        it easier to understand and work with.\\n\\n2. **Single Endpoint**: Unlike
        REST APIs that have multiple endpoints, GraphQL has a single endpoint. The
        client specifies exactly what data it needs, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching
        of data.\\n\\n3. **Queries and Mutations**: GraphQL uses queries to fetch
        data and mutations to change data (create, update, delete). Here's a simple
        example of a query:\\n\\n   ```graphql\\n   {\\n     user(id: 1) {\\n       name\\n
        \      email\\n     }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Schema Definition Language
        (SDL)**: GraphQL uses SDL to define the types and fields in your schema. It's
        used to generate type-safe code and documentation.\\n\\n5. **Real-time Updates**:
        GraphQL supports subscriptions, which allow clients to receive real-time updates
        when data changes.\\n\\n6. **Introspection and Code Generation**: GraphQL
        supports introspection, allowing tools to extract information about the schema,
        generate code, and more.\\n\\nHere's a simple example of a GraphQL schema:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype
        User {\\n  id: ID!\\n  name: String!\\n  email: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype Query
        {\\n  user(id: ID!): User\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this schema, we have a `User`
        type with fields `id`, `name`, and `email`. We also have a `Query` type with
        a single field `user` that takes an `id` argument and returns a `User`.\\n\\nGraphQL
        is used by many large companies including Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more.
        It's often used as an alternative or complement to REST APIs.\\n\\nTo learn
