        is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers
        to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message, or method
        call, in different ways. It allows for methods to operate on objects of different
        classes through a common interface. There are two primary types of polymorphism
        in OOP: compile-time (or static) polymorphism and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism.\\n\\n1.
        **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):**\\n   - Achieved through
        method overloading and operator overloading.\\n   - Method Overloading: This
        involves having multiple methods in the same class with the same name but
        different signatures (different parameter lists). The correct method to invoke
        is determined at compile time based on the method signature.\\n   - Operator
        Overloading: This allows operators (like +, -, *, etc.) to have different
        meanings based on their context, often used in languages like C++.\\n\\n2.
        **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):**\\n   - Achieved through method
        overriding. This involves redefining a method in a subclass that is already
        defined in the superclass.\\n   - The actual method that gets invoked is determined
        at runtime, based on the object's type (not the reference type).\\n   - It
        requires a base class reference (or pointer) and a derived class object. In
        many OOP languages, this is typically implemented using virtual functions
        or interfaces.\\n   - This type of polymorphism gives flexibility and allows
        one to write more generic and reusable code. It is the cornerstone of achieving
        runtime dynamic behavior in applications.\\n\\n### Benefits of Polymorphism:\\n-
        **Simplified Code Management:** It allows developers to write more generic
        code and handle different types via a unified interface.\\n- **Extensibility:**
        New object types can be introduced with minimal changes to existing code.\\n-
        **Maintenance and Scalability:** Enhances code readability and maintenance
        as changes in code are less prone to errors.\\n- **Dynamic Behavior:** Provides
        flexibility in reusing existing implementations while allowing for new implementations.\\n\\nBy
        leveraging polymorphism effectively, software architects can design systems
        that are easier to scale, maintain, and enhance over time.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_cbf1785567\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":13,\"completion_tokens\":432,\"total_tokens\":445,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
