        is an acronym that stands for five object-oriented design principles intended
        to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
        They are fundamental principles that help developers create more stable and
        scalable code. Here's a breakdown of each principle:\\n\\n1. **Single Responsibility
        Principle (SRP)**\\n   - A class should have only one reason to change.\\n
        \  - This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility. If
        a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled, and changes
        to one responsibility may impair the others, leading to unexpected side effects.\\n
        \  - Benefits: Easier to test, understand, and maintain.\\n\\n2. **Open-Closed
        Principle (OCP)**\\n   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.)
        should be open for extension but closed for modification.\\n   - This means
        that you should be able to extend a class's behavior, without modifying it.
        This can be achieved through techniques like inheritance, composition, or
        extension methods.\\n   - Benefits: Prevents breaking existing functionality
        when adding new features.\\n\\n3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\\n
        \  - If a program is using a base class, it should be able to use any of its
        subclasses without the program knowing.\\n   - This means that subclasses
        must be substitutable for their base classes. If a program is using a base
        class, it should be able to use any of its subclasses without the program
        knowing.\\n   - Benefits: Ensures that inheritance hierarchies are well-structured
        and do not break the expectations of the program.\\n\\n4. **Interface Segregation
        Principle (ISP)**\\n   - Make fine-grained interfaces that are client-specific.\\n
        \  - This means that it's better to have many smaller, more specific interfaces
        than one large, general-purpose interface. Clients should only see methods
        they're interested in.\\n   - Benefits: Reduces dependencies, makes code easier
        to understand and maintain.\\n\\n5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\\n
        \  - Depend upon abstractions, [do not] depend upon concretions.\\n   - This
        means that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both
        should depend on abstractions. This can be achieved through techniques like
        dependency injection.\\n   - Benefits: Reduces coupling, makes code more flexible
        and easier to test.\\n\\nBy following these principles, developers can create
        more modular, maintainable, and extensible code.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10,\"completion_tokens\":485,\"total_tokens\":495,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}"
