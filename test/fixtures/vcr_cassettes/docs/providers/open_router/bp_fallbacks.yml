        APIs are a type of web service architecture that applies the principles of
        Representational State Transfer (REST) for creating and interacting with web
        services. REST was introduced by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation,
        and it has become a widely adopted standard for designing networked applications.\\n\\n###
        Core Principles of RESTful APIs:\\n\\n1. **Statelessness**: Each request from
        a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to
        fulfill that request. This means that the server does not store any session
        state about the client, and each request is processed as an independent transaction.\\n\\n2.
        **Client-Server Architecture**: REST promotes a separation of concerns, where
        clients and servers interact through a uniform interface. Clients are responsible
        for managing user interfaces and application states, while servers handle
        the storage and retrieval of resources.\\n\\n3. **Cacheability**: Responses
        from the server must be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable. If
        a response is cacheable, then the client can reuse that response data for
        later, similar requests, which improves efficiency and performance.\\n\\n4.
        **Uniform Interface**: This principle is one of the key aspects of REST. It
        simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve
        independently. There are four constraints within this principle:\\n   - **Identification
        of resources**: Resources are identified using URIs. Each resource, such as
        a user or a product, has a specific URL.\\n   - **Manipulation of resources
        through representations**: Clients manipulate resources using their representations,
        such as JSON or XML.\\n   - **Self-descriptive messages**: Each message includes
        enough information to describe how to process the message. This includes a
        clear definition of how to process the payload.\\n   - **Hypermedia as the
        engine of application state (HATEOAS)**: Clients interact with the application
        entirely through provided links, navigating the available choices dynamically.\\n\\n5.
        **Layered System**: REST architecture can have multiple layers, with each
        layer having specific responsibilities, like load balancing or shared caches,
        enhancing system flexibility and scalability.\\n\\n### Usage of RESTful APIs:\\n\\nRESTful
        APIs commonly use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:\\n\\n-
        **GET**: Retrieve a representation of a resource.\\n- **POST**: Create a new
        resource or perform some action.\\n- **PUT**: Update an existing resource.\\n-
        **DELETE**: Remove a resource.\\n\\n### Benefits of RESTful APIs:\\n\\n- **Scalability**:
        By using a stateless operation and layering, RESTful APIs can scale easily.\\n-
        **Flexibility and Portability**: The separation of client and server helps
        in the portability of the interface across different platforms and devices.\\n-
        **Simplicity and Uniformity**: RESTful APIs operate through a uniform set
        of operations, making the API easier to understand and use.\\n\\n### Widely
        Used Formats:\\n\\n- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: Due to its lightweight
        and human-readable format, JSON is widely preferred for RESTful APIs.\\n-
        **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: Another format that is used but is more
        verbose than JSON.\\n\\nRESTful APIs provide a powerful standard for building
        web services, favored for their simplicity and alignment with the stateless
        nature of HTTP. This has led to their pervasive use across a wide array of
        applications and industries.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_cbf1785567\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":11,\"completion_tokens\":674,\"total_tokens\":685,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
