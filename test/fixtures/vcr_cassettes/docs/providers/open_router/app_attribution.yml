        design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem in software design.
        It's not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but
        rather a description of how to solve a problem that you can use in many different
        situations. Design patterns are like blueprints for solving common programming
        challenges.\\n\\nHere are some key aspects of design patterns:\\n\\n1. **Intent**:
        The purpose or goal of the pattern.\\n2. **Also Known As**: Alternative names
        for the pattern.\\n3. **Motivation**: A description of the problem that the
        pattern solves.\\n4. **Applicability**: The situations in which the pattern
        can be applied.\\n5. **Structure**: A graphical representation of the pattern,
        showing the classes and objects involved and their relationships.\\n6. **Participants**:
        The classes and objects involved in the pattern, and their responsibilities.\\n7.
        **Collaborations**: How the participants interact with each other to carry
        out their responsibilities.\\n8. **Consequences**: The results and trade-offs
        of applying the pattern, including its strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nThere
        are three main categories of design patterns:\\n\\n- **Creational Patterns**:
        Deal with object creation mechanisms to increase flexibility and reuse of
        existing code.\\n- **Structural Patterns**: Concerned with the composition
        of classes or objects into larger structures while keeping these structures
        efficient.\\n- **Behavioral Patterns**: Describe communication patterns between
        objects and how they interact with each other.\\n\\nSome popular design patterns
        include Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Decorator, and many more.
        They help developers create more flexible, maintainable, and extensible code.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":11,\"completion_tokens\":318,\"total_tokens\":329,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}"
