        fun fact about Ruby is that it was designed with developer happiness in mind.
        Yukihiro \\\"Matz\\\" Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby, aimed to create a language
        that was both powerful and easy to use, allowing programmers to express their
        ideas in a natural and intuitive way. This philosophy is reflected in Ruby's
        elegant syntax and flexible structure.\\n\\nThis fact is interesting because
        it highlights a fundamental aspect of programming language design that often
        gets overlooked: the human experience. Many programming languages prioritize
        performance or technical capabilities, but Ruby's focus on developer happiness
        encourages creativity and productivity. It fosters a positive environment
        for coding, which can lead to more innovative solutions and a more enjoyable
        development process. As a result, Ruby has garnered a passionate community
        of developers who appreciate not just the language itself, but also the philosophy
        behind it.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_560af6e559\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":20,\"completion_tokens\":165,\"total_tokens\":185,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
