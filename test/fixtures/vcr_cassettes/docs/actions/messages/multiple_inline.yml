        fun fact about Ruby is that it was created by Yukihiro \\\"Matz\\\" Matsumoto
        in the mid-1990s, and he designed it to be a programming language that balanced
        functional and imperative programming, making it both powerful and easy to
        use. \\n\\nWhat's interesting about this is that Ruby's design philosophy
        emphasizes productivity and simplicity, which is why it became the foundation
        for the popular web framework Ruby on Rails. The framework revolutionized
        web development by introducing conventions that allowed developers to build
        applications quickly and efficiently. As a result, Ruby not only emerged as
        a beloved programming language for developers but also played a significant
        role in shaping modern web development practices. This balance of functionality
        and developer-friendly design is what has contributed to Ruby's enduring popularity
        and community support.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_560af6e559\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":20,\"completion_tokens\":154,\"total_tokens\":174,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
