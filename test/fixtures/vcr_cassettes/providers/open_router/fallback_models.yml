        is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and it refers
        to the ability of different objects to be treated as instances of the same
        class through a common interface. The most common type of polymorphism in
        OOP is through methods.\\n\\n### Types of Polymorphism\\n\\n1. **Compile-Time
        Polymorphism (Static Binding or Method Overloading):**\\n   - This type of
        polymorphism is resolved during the compile time.\\n   - Method Overloading:
        It occurs when multiple methods have the same name with different parameters
        (either in number, type, or order) within the same class or in a subclass.
        The compiler determines the appropriate method based on the method signature
        during compile time.\\n   - Example: \\n     ```java\\n     class Printer
        {\\n         void print(int num) {\\n             System.out.println(\\\"Integer:
        \\\" + num);\\n         }\\n         void print(String text) {\\n             System.out.println(\\\"String:
        \\\" + text);\\n         }\\n     }\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Runtime Polymorphism
        (Dynamic Binding or Method Overriding):**\\n   - This type of polymorphism
        is resolved during runtime.\\n   - Method Overriding: It occurs when a subclass
        has a method with the same name and signature as a method in its superclass.
        The decisions regarding which method to call are made at runtime based on
        the object's actual type.\\n   - Example:\\n     ```java\\n     class Animal
        {\\n         void sound() {\\n             System.out.println(\\\"Animal sound\\\");\\n
        \        }\\n     }\\n\\n     class Dog extends Animal {\\n         @Override\\n
        \        void sound() {\\n             System.out.println(\\\"Bark\\\");\\n
        \        }\\n     }\\n\\n     public class Test {\\n         public static
        void main(String[] args) {\\n             Animal myDog = new Dog();\\n             myDog.sound();
        \ // Outputs: Bark\\n         }\\n     }\\n     ```\\n   - In the example
        above, even though `myDog` is declared as an `Animal`, it refers to an instance
        of `Dog`, and thus the `sound` method of `Dog` is invoked.\\n\\n### Importance
        of Polymorphism\\n\\n- **Code Reusability:** By using polymorphism, a single
        function can operate on different types of objects, enhancing reusability.\\n-
        **Scalability and Maintainability:** Polymorphism allows systems to be easily
        extended and modified. Adding new subclasses or method implementations doesn't
        require changing existing code.\\n- **Interface Implementation:** It allows
        objects to be manipulated regardless of their specific class, upholding the
        principle of programming to an interface rather than an implementation.\\n\\nOverall,
        polymorphism contributes to the flexibility and scalability of code, making
        it easier to handle changes and complexity in software design.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_cbf1785567\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":13,\"completion_tokens\":541,\"total_tokens\":554,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
