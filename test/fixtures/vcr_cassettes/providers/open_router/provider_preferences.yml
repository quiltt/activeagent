        is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It
        is the practice of keeping fields within a class private (or protected) and
        providing access to them through public methods (getters and setters). This
        helps to achieve data hiding and abstraction, which are crucial for software
        security, stability, and maintainability.\\n\\nHere are some key aspects of
        encapsulation:\\n\\n1. **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation hides the internal state
        of an object from the outside world. This means that the internal data (attributes)
        of an object are not directly accessible from outside the object. Instead,
        they can only be accessed or modified through methods (functions) provided
        by the class.\\n\\n2. **Abstraction**: Encapsulation allows you to define
        what data is accessible and how it can be accessed. This helps to create a
        clear interface for interacting with an object, making the code easier to
        understand and use.\\n\\n3. **Control**: By using methods to access and modify
        data, you can add logic and validation to ensure that the data remains in
        a valid state. This gives you control over how the data is used and helps
        to prevent errors.\\n\\n4. **Protection**: Encapsulation protects the internal
        data from being accidentally modified or accessed in an unauthorized way.
        This can help prevent bugs and security vulnerabilities.\\n\\nHere's a simple
        example in Python:\\n\\n```python\\nclass BankAccount:\\n    def __init__(self,
        balance=0):\\n        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\\n\\n
        \   def deposit(self, amount):\\n        if amount > 0:\\n            self.__balance
        += amount\\n\\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\\n        if 0 < amount <=
        self.__balance:\\n            self.__balance -= amount\\n\\n    def get_balance(self):\\n
        \       return self.__balance\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `balance` attribute
        is private (denoted by the double underscore prefix), and the only way to
        access or modify it is through the `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance`
        methods. This helps to ensure that the balance is always a valid amount.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":9,\"completion_tokens\":421,\"total_tokens\":430,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}"
