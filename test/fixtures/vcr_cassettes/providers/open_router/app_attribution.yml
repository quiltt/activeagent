        design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem in software design.
        It's not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but
        rather a template for how to solve a problem that you can use in many different
        situations. Design patterns provide a common language and a set of tried-and-true
        solutions to common problems, making it easier to communicate and understand
        designs.\\n\\nHere are some key aspects of design patterns:\\n\\n1. **Intent**:
        The purpose or goal of the pattern.\\n2. **Also Known As**: Other names the
        pattern might be known by.\\n3. **Motivation**: A description of the problem
        that the pattern solves.\\n4. **Applicability**: The situations in which the
        pattern can be applied.\\n5. **Structure**: A graphical representation of
        the pattern, showing the classes and objects involved and their relationships.\\n6.
        **Participants**: The classes and objects involved in the pattern and their
        responsibilities.\\n7. **Collaborations**: How the participants interact with
        each other to carry out their responsibilities.\\n8. **Consequences**: The
        results and trade-offs of applying the pattern, including its strengths and
        weaknesses.\\n\\nThere are three main categories of design patterns:\\n\\n-
        **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create
        objects in a manner suitable to the situation.\\n- **Structural Patterns**:
        Concerned with the composition of classes or objects, and provide simple ways
        to realize relationships among them.\\n- **Behavioral Patterns**: Describe
        communication patterns among objects and how they interact with each other.\\n\\nSome
        of the most well-known design patterns include Singleton, Factory, Observer,
        Strategy, and Decorator, among many others. They are widely used in software
        development to improve the quality, flexibility, and maintainability of the
        code.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":11,\"completion_tokens\":353,\"total_tokens\":364,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null}}"
