It is designed to make the process of developing web applications easier and more efficient by following the principle of \"Convention over Configuration\" and the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) philosophy. Here are some key features:\n\n1. **MVC Architecture**: Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which separates application logic into three interconnected components, making it easier to organize code and manage the application.\n\n2. **Convention over Configuration**: Rails provides a set of conventions for naming and organizing your code, which reduces the need for configuration files and allows developers to focus on writing code rather than setting up the environment.\n\n3. **Active Record**: This is the object-relational mapping (ORM) layer in Rails that allows developers to interact with the database using Ruby objects, simplifying CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n\n4. **Scaffolding**: Rails has scaffolding capabilities that enable quick generation of the necessary components for a standard web application, such as models, views, and controllers.\n\n5. **Rich Ecosystem**: Rails has a vibrant community and a wide range of libraries (gems) that can be easily integrated into applications to add functionality.\n\n6. **RESTful Design**: Rails encourages building applications using RESTful architecture, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.\n\n7. **Security Features**: Rails has built-in mechanisms to help protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.\n\nRails is particularly favored for its ability to help developers rapidly build applications, making it popular among startups and for prototyping new ideas."
