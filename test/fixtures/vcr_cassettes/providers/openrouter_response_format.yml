        the user is asking \\\"What is 10-3?\\\" That's a straightforward subtraction
        problem. Let me think. Subtraction is taking one number away from another.
        So 10 minus 3. Let me visualize it. If I have 10 apples and I take away 3,
        how many are left? 10-3 would be 7. Wait, is there any chance they might be
        asking something else? Like maybe in a different context, such as time or
        a different number system? But the question is pretty simple, just 10 minus
        3. The standard answer should be 7. I don't think they're trying to trick
        me here. Maybe they're testing if I can handle basic math. Let me confirm
        by breaking it down: 10 minus 3. Starting from 10, subtract 3. 10-1=9, 9-1=8,
        8-1=7. Yep, that's three times. So the answer is definitely 7. I should just
        state it clearly.\\n\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":29,\"completion_tokens\":243,\"total_tokens\":272}}"
