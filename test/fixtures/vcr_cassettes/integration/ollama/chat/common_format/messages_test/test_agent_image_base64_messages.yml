        unable to see or interpret any images unless you upload them directly into
        this chat. No file was received with your question.\n\nTo help me understand
        what''s in the image, please:\n\n1.  **Upload** the `.svg` file (it doesn''t
        need a special extension like \".jpg\" for processing).\n2.  Or, if describing
        it is manageable, tell me you''re trying to upload an image and describe the
        content *in your mind*.","reasoning":"Hmm, the user is asking about an image
        but hasn''t actually provided one. What a common scenario! They probably clicked
        \"Send Image\" without realizing they need to upload first.\n\nOkay, let me
        break this down. The core issue here isn''t technical - I can still help them
        learn how we interact with images despite not seeing their specific file.
        The user might be feeling frustrated if they expected just an answer about
        their image, or maybe confused by the interface.\n\nI should first acknowledge
        that no image was received while making our process absolutely clear: 1) We
        need to receive and analyze actual content 2) I''ll demonstrate how this works
        with current capabilities 3) Offer practical alternatives like describing
        what''s in mind. \n\nThe tone needs to be helpful but not condescending -
        they''re just following basic steps correctly for regular queries, so it shouldn''t
        feel like their lack of technical knowledge is being highlighted negatively.\n\nAlternative
        approach: Maybe the user thinks we can predict images from text alone? I should
        gently clarify that limitation while showing how our system would normally
        function for image-based questions.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":13,"completion_tokens":316,"total_tokens":329}}
