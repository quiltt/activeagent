        the context of **pigment** and traditional **art**, there are three primary
        colors:\n\n1.  Red\n2.  Yellow\n3.  Blue\n\nThese combine (subtractively)
        to create all other colors.\n\nHowever, in the context of **light** and digital
        displays (**additive color theory**), the three primary colors are:\n\n*   Red\n*   Green\n*   Blue\n\nOften
        abbreviated as RGB.","reasoning":"Okay, the user asked me to list three primary
        colors. Let me start by recalling that primary colors depend on context. In
        art and design, it''s usually red, yellow, blue for pigments. The RYB model
        is widely taught in schools, so the user might be expecting a basic answer
        unless they specify another context.\n\nWait, but maybe they have a different
        background? Like digital or physics. Primary colors there are red, green,
        blue (RGB). Need to mention both possibilities because I don''t know for sure
        what they''re referring to.\n\nHmm, should I just give the RYB model first
        and then add RGB as an alternative? The user might not be aware that contexts
        vary. They might think primary colors are a fixed set, but it''s actually
        context-dependent. Including both models shows thoroughness without assuming
        their knowledge level.\n\nAlso, considering why they''re asking. Maybe for
        a school project or general curiosity. Either way, being clear and accurate
        is key. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary. Keep the answer simple with
        brief explanations for each color in each model to show understanding of basics
        like light vs pigment mixing.\n\nNeed to check if there''s any ambiguity between
        models. For example, RGB is additive (light sources) while subtractive (like
        paints or digital screens) use RYB. The user didn''t specify, so it''s safer
        to present both possibilities as they''re equally standard depending on context.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":7,"completion_tokens":381,"total_tokens":388}}
