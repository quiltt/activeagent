        are to return a JSON object that has one key: \"colors\"\n The value of \"colors\"
        should be an array containing the three primary colors.\n Primary colors typically
        refer to red, blue, and yellow (in subtractive color models like paint) OR\n
        In additive color models (like RGB), we have red, green, blue.\n However,
        the problem doesn''t specify one model or another. Let''s assume the common
        primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.\n\n So, we can create a JSON object:
        { \"colors\": [\"red\", \"blue\", \"yellow\"] }\n\n But note: sometimes people
        might think of RGB primaries (red, green, blue). However, without specification,
        let''s choose subtractive as it is more traditional for primary colors in
        art.\n\n If the problem intended any particular definition, we can adjust.
        Since not specified, I''ll use red, blue, yellow.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":202,"completion_tokens":10,"total_tokens":212}}
