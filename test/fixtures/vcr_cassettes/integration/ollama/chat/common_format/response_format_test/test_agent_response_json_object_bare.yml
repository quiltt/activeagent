        are going to return a JSON object that has a key \"_result\" which contains
        an array of three primary colors.\n The typical primary colors in the context
        of this problem might be red, blue, and yellow. \n However, note that sometimes
        people say RGB primary colors (red, green, blue) but traditionally, the subtractive
        color primaries are cyan, magenta, and yellow.\n But since the user specifically
        said \"primary colors\", without further specification, I''ll go with red,
        blue, and yellow as these are often considered in elementary contexts.\n\n
        Let''s define:\n   - Three primary colors: \"red\", \"blue\", \"yellow\"\n\n
        We want to return a JSON object like:\n {\n   \"_result\": [\"red\", \"blue\",
        \"yellow\"]\n }\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify which
        ones. Since it says \"three primary colors\", I''ll assume the common ones.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":201,"completion_tokens":11,"total_tokens":212}}
