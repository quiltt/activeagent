        function requires it, so I can''t proceed without that info. Let me check
        the function details again. Yes, location is a required parameter. Since the
        user didn''t mention where, I should prompt them to provide the location so
        I can fetch the weather data. Alright, time to respond by asking for the location.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":137,"completion_tokens":151,"total_tokens":288}}
