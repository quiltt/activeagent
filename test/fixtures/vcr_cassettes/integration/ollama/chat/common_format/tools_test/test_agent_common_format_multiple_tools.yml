        let''s tackle this user query. The user is asking two things: the weather

        arithmetic operations. \n\nFor the first part, \"What''s the weather in NYC?\",
        I should call get_weather with the location parameter set to \"NYC\". That
        should retrieve the current weather data.\n\nNext, the second part is \"what''s
        5 plus 3?\" Here, the operation is addition. The calculate function requires
        operation, a, and b. So operation is \"add\", a is 5, and b is 3. I''ll need
