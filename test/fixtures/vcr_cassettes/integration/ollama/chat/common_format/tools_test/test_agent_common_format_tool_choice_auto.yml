        I need to call the get_weather function, which requires a location parameter.
        Since the user didn''t provide one, I should ask them to clarify where they
        want the weather information for. Let me check the function details again
        to confirm the parameters. The function requires ''location'' as a string.
        Alright, so I can''t proceed without that info. Time to prompt the user for
        the missing details.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":137,"completion_tokens":118,"total_tokens":255}}
