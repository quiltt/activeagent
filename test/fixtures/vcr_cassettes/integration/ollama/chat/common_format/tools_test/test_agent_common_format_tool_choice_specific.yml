        function''s parameters are required to have \"location\", so I can''t call
        it without that info. Since the user didn''t provide it, I should prompt them
        to specify the location so I can retrieve the weather. Let me check the function
        again to confirm. Yep, location is required. Alright, time to ask the user
        for the location details.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":137,"completion_tokens":157,"total_tokens":294}}
