        computing is a new way of processing information using the principles of quantum
        mechanics, which is the science of how things work at the smallest scales,
        like atoms and subatomic particles. In classical computing, information is
        processed using bits, which can be either a 0 or a 1. However, quantum computing
        uses quantum bits, or qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time due
        to a property called superposition. This allows quantum computers to process
        a vast amount of information simultaneously.\\n\\nAdditionally, qubits can
        be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another,
        no matter how far apart they are. This property, called entanglement, allows
        quantum computers to potentially solve complex problems much faster than classical
        computers. Quantum computers also use interference, the idea that quantum
        states can combine in ways that amplify some outcomes and cancel others, thus
        steering the computation in useful ways.\\n\\nOverall, quantum computing holds
        great promise for tasks that are very difficult for classical computers, like
        simulating molecules for drug discovery or factoring large numbers for cryptography.
        However, building practical quantum computers is extremely challenging and
        is the subject of ongoing research.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_65564d8ba5\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":14,\"completion_tokens\":238,\"total_tokens\":252,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
