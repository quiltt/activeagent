        fun fact about Ruby programming is that it was designed with the principle
        of \\\"least astonishment\\\" in mind. This means that the language is intended
        to behave in a way that minimizes unexpected surprises for users, helping
        to ensure that code works intuitively and as expected.\\n\\nThis principle
        is interesting because it highlights the focus on developer happiness and
        productivity that Ruby emphasizes. Unlike some languages that might prioritize
        performance or strict paradigms, Ruby's creator, Yukihiro \\\"Matz\\\" Matsumoto,
        placed a strong emphasis on making the language enjoyable to use. This approach
        has contributed to Ruby's reputation for simplicity and readability, making
        it especially popular for rapid web development with frameworks like Ruby
        on Rails. As a result, developers can often express their ideas more naturally
        and with less cognitive load, leading to more efficient and enjoyable coding
        experiences.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_cbf1785567\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":21,\"completion_tokens\":166,\"total_tokens\":187,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
