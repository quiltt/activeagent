        fun fact about Ruby programming is that the language was named after a gemstone
        as a play on words. Its creator, Yukihiro \\\"Matz\\\" Matsumoto, named it
        after a colleague jokingly suggested it to follow Python, which was named
        after the comedic group Monty Python. Matz wanted to create a language that
        was \\\"more valuable\\\" than other gems like Perl, which are also named
        after precious items.\\n\\nThis is interesting because it highlights the playful
        and creative environment in which Ruby was developed. The naming reflects
        not just a sense of humor but also a philosophy. Ruby emphasizes programmer
        happiness and productivity, focusing on simplicity and elegance. This mindset
        has resulted in a community and culture that values aesthetics and readability,
        which are hallmarks of the Ruby programming language. This approach has significantly
        influenced modern programming practices and frameworks, making Ruby a uniquely
        enjoyable language to work with.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_cbf1785567\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":21,\"completion_tokens\":176,\"total_tokens\":197,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
