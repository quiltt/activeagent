        fun fact about Ruby programming is that its creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto (often
        referred to as \\\"Matz\\\"), designed Ruby to make programmers happy, focusing
        on productivity and enjoyment. He wanted to create a language that was not
        only powerful but also enjoyable to write, which led him to develop Ruby with
        simple, elegant syntax inspired by languages like Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel,
        Ada, and Lisp. \\n\\nThe interesting aspect of this fact is that it highlights
        the philosophy behind Ruby, which is quite different from many other programming
        languages that often prioritize performance or technical capability first.
        By focusing on developer happiness, Ruby fosters a community and environment
        where creativity and expressiveness are valued. This approach has influenced
        how modern programming languages are designed, as seen in languages like Python
        and Elixir, which also prioritize developer experience. This philosophy has
        contributed significantly to Ruby's popularity, especially in web development
        through frameworks like Ruby on Rails.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_65564d8ba5\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":21,\"completion_tokens\":185,\"total_tokens\":206,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
