        fun fact about Ruby programming is that its creator, Yukihiro \\\"Matz\\\"
        Matsumoto, designed the language to make programmers happy. This philosophy
        is often summarized by the Ruby community mantra, \\\"Matz is nice and so
        we are nice\\\" (MINASWAN). \\n\\nThis fact is interesting because it highlights
        a fundamental philosophy behind Ruby's design and evolution. Unlike many programming
        languages that prioritize machine efficiency, Ruby focuses on developer happiness
        and productivity. Matz aimed to create a language that was natural and easy
        to read, borrowing the best aspects of other languages like Perl, Smalltalk,
        and Lisp.\\n\\nThe emphasis on programmer satisfaction has influenced Ruby's
        features such as its elegant syntax, flexibility, and the vibrant community
        that supports it. This community-centered culture encourages collaboration
        and sharing, which has led to a rich collection of libraries and tools that
        make development faster and more enjoyable. As a result, Ruby is not only
        a tool for solving technical problems but also a medium for creative and joyful
        expression in software development.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_65564d8ba5\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":21,\"completion_tokens\":204,\"total_tokens\":225,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}}}"
