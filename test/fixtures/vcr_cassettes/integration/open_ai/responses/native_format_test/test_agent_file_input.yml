                  "text": "This file is a **shareholder letter from Berkshire Hathaway Inc.**, written by Warren E. Buffett, as part of the company's annual report for the year ended 2024. Here\u2019s a summary of what's included in this file:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Purpose and Philosophy of the Letter**\n- Warren Buffett explains the company's ethos in shareholder communication, emphasizing transparency about both successes and failures.\n- He highlights the importance of discussing mistakes, following the advice of Tom Murphy: \u201cpraise by name, criticize by category.\u201d\n\n### 2. **Mistakes and Management**\n- Buffett candidly talks about his mistakes in business decisions, both in acquisitions and in hiring, stressing the importance of prompt action when errors are realized.\n\n### 3. **Transition of Leadership**\n- Buffett indicates that at age 94, he will soon be succeeded by Greg Abel as CEO, who will continue the tradition of candid annual reporting.\n\n### 4. **Story of Pete Liegl and Forest River**\n- Buffett tells the acquisition story of Forest River and its outstanding manager, Pete Liegl.\n- Highlights Liegl\u2019s humility, integrity, and the extraordinary impact he had on Berkshire\u2019s wealth.\n\n### 5. **Education and Management Selection**\n- Buffett repeats his often-stated view that he never considers school pedigree in management selection and supports innate talent over credentials.\n\n### 6. **Review of 2024 Performance**\n- Berkshire had a better-than-expected year. Over half its businesses saw earnings fall, but gains in investment income and insurance, especially through GEICO (led by Todd Combs), led to strong results.\n- Operating earnings for 2024 were $47.4 billion (excluding capital gains/losses).\n\n### 7. **Tax Contributions**\n- Berkshire paid a record $26.8 billion in U.S. corporate taxes in 2024\u2014a feat unmatched by any U.S. company and a testament to decades of retained earnings and reinvestment instead of dividends.\n\n### 8. **Asset Allocation Overview**\n- Berkshire\u2019s vast holdings are split between wholly-owned subsidiaries (189 businesses) and significant minority stakes in major companies (like Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, Moody\u2019s).\n- As of year-end, marketable equities were valued at $272 billion, down from $354 billion, but controlled businesses increased in value.\n- Buffett reaffirms a preference for equities, especially American ones, over cash or fixed-coupon bonds.\n\n### 9. **Capitalism and America**\n- Reflects on how capitalism, despite faults, has enabled American progress, with Berkshire as a small participant in that larger story.\n\n### 10. **Property-Casualty Insurance (P/C)**\n- Details the unique economics and risks of P/C insurance.\n- Berkshire\u2019s float (funds held from premiums before they are paid out in claims) and underwriting profits have steadily grown.\n- Ajit Jain, leading this business, is praised for honesty, caution, and capability.\n\n### 11. **Japanese Investments**\n- Berkshire has significant, long-term investments in five Japanese trading companies: ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo.\n- Position is yen-hedged, and dividends from these holdings are expected to outpace interest costs on Berkshire\u2019s yen-denominated debt.\n\n### 12. **Annual Meeting and Community**\n- Announcement of Berkshire\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, details about products, a commemorative book, and charitable fundraising.\n- Lighthearted stories about Buffett\u2019s family.\n\n### 13. **Performance Tables**\n- Long-term track record table compares Berkshire\u2019s annual return to the S&P 500 (with dividends) from 1965 through 2024.\n- Shows compounded annual gain of 19.9% for Berkshire stock versus 10.4% for the S&P 500, and an overall gain since 1964 of 5,502,284% vs. 39,054%.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThis is the 2024 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder letter, reviewing the company\u2019s philosophy, leadership, business performance, mistakes and successes, major investments, and long-term results. It provides insight into Buffett\u2019s thinking, Berkshire\u2019s operations, attitudes towards money management, and a recap of 60 years of remarkable growth."
