# Dev Console (Dashboard Engine)

The dashboard is its own gem. `activeagent` is the framework — agents,
providers, generation, telemetry reporting — and `actionagent` is a mountable
Rails engine that adds the dashboard on top of it: every agent generation
recorded as a trace with a span waterfall, a metrics overview, and the
agent builder, interactions and evaluations alongside them — running
inside your app against your own database while you build. The hosted
[activeagents.ai](https://activeagents.ai) platform mounts the same engine,
so what you see locally in development is what the platform shows (plus the
accounts, plans, billing and managed sandbox infrastructure a hosted
product has to have) once you point telemetry at it. Every platform
workspace starts with a free low-volume trial.

![Dashboard: traces list with expandable span timelines]

## Quick start

The dashboard's models are Active Record models and its runs persist
conversations, so `actionagent` adds `activerecord` and
[solid_agent](/solid_agent) on top of what the framework already pulls in —
neither of which `activeagent` itself requires. Add both gems:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "activeagent"
gem "actionagent"
```

```bash
bundle install
rails generate action_agent:install
rails db:migrate
```

The generator:

- copies three migrations — `active_agent_telemetry_traces` (the trace
  store), `active_agent_dashboard_tables` (agents, runs, versions,
  conversations, evaluations, sandboxes, recordings, keys) and
  `active_agent_evaluation_scenarios` (scenario suites and their per-model
  results; re-run the generator on an existing install to get it); pass
  `--traces_only` for a trace sink alone,
- mounts the engine at `/activeagents`,
- writes `config/initializers/action_agent.rb`.

API keys and provider credentials are encrypted at rest, so run
`rails db:encryption:init` before creating any (or set
`ActionAgent.encrypt_credentials = false` to store them in plain
text — a deliberate downgrade, not a default).

Deploying this beyond your laptop — for a team, or as the trace sink for
a fleet of apps? See
[Self-Hosted Observability](/framework/self-hosted-observability).

Then enable telemetry with local storage in `config/active_agent.yml`:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  local_storage: true
```

That's it. Run any agent and open `/activeagents` — each generation
appears as a trace with prompt/LLM/tool spans, timing, token usage
(input / output / thinking), provider and model. The dashboard's React
bundle ships prebuilt in the `actionagent` gem, so mounting it doesn't ask
your app to run a JavaScript build.

`local_storage: true` writes traces through the engine's trace model, so it
only works in the app that mounts the engine. Without `actionagent`
installed, telemetry logs that it has nowhere to write — apps that only run
agents point telemetry at an `endpoint:` instead (see below).

## What you get

| Page | Path | Contents |
|------|------|----------|
| Ask ActiveAgents | `/activeagents/assistant` | Ask about recorded evaluations and prepare an agent draft for review (development and test only — see below) |
| Agents | `/activeagents` | Your agents with per-agent request, token and error stats; build, edit, version them, and test them as a user in the Run Agent workbench (see below) |
| Traces | `/activeagents/traces` | Every generation: agent + action, status, duration, tokens; expandable span timeline; All/Errors filter; 30s auto-refresh |
| Metrics | `/activeagents/metrics` | The service overview: golden signals, six time series over 1h/24h/7d, and the top agents, models, actions, tools and error types (see below) |
| Interactions | `/activeagents/interactions` | The conversations behind the traces: messages, tool calls, generations |
| Evaluations | `/activeagents/evaluations` | Scored agent outputs, and scenario suites replayed across models (see below) |
| Console | `/activeagents/console/traces` | The same traces and metrics server-rendered, without JavaScript; span waterfall per trace at `/activeagents/console/traces/:id` |
| Ingest API | `POST /activeagents/api/traces` | JSON trace ingestion from other apps and SDKs (`local_storage` writes through the model instead, no HTTP) |

## Testing an agent as a user

Every agent page has a **Run Agent** button. It opens a workbench that works
the agent the way a user would — a conversation, not a one-shot prompt box —
so you can watch what the model is given, change it, and run again.

![Run Agent: a pinned conversation with the live activity feed and the composer](/dashboard/runner-overview.png)

**Add user messages.** Type a message and press Run (or ⌘/Ctrl+Enter). The
run executes under the agent's instructions and the selected action, and the
reply streams into the conversation with the same LLM/tool activity feed the
Interactions view shows. The conversation is *pinned*: the next message is
sent with every user and assistant turn before it, so "and which one grew
fastest?" means what it would mean to a person. Each run is still its own
`AgentRun` with its own trace, which is how Traces and Interactions keep
showing exactly what the model saw.

The workbench follows the dashboard theme:

![Run Agent in dark mode](/dashboard/runner-overview-dark.png)

**Modify the context.** The conversation on the page is the persisted
solid_agent context, and it is editable: hover a turn to **edit** or
**delete** it, use **Add message** to seed a user or assistant turn without
running anything, and **New conversation** to start from an empty context.
The system row shows the composed instructions the run executes under (edit
those on the Instructions tab). Editing a previous question and asking a
follow-up is the quickest way to see how an agent handles a changed history.

![Context editing: the second question rewritten, and the follow-up answering the rewritten history](/dashboard/runner-context-editing.png)

<video src="/dashboard/runner-context.webm" controls muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**Attach files.** Files attached to a message upload with the run through
Active Storage (`AgentRun has_many_attached :attachments`), and reach the
model according to their kind: images as vision input, PDFs as documents,
and text-like files — CSV, Markdown, JSON, plain text — inlined into the
message, with the filename and size in a header the model can cite. The
persisted user message keeps an attachment manifest, so the conversation
shows the thumbnails afterwards. A host app without Active Storage keeps
everything else and answers attachment uploads with a clear 422.

![Attachments: an image described by the model, and a PDF summarised into a card](/dashboard/runner-attachments-image.png)

<video src="/dashboard/runner-attachments.webm" controls muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**Generative UI.** An assistant reply can carry UI instead of, or alongside,
prose: cards, stats, tables, charts, lists, progress bars, forms, choice
buttons, images, callouts and code. Three ways in, all rendered by the same
component:

- a fenced ```` ```ui ```` block in a markdown reply whose body is JSON —
  an array of blocks, or `{ "blocks": [...] }`;
- a JSON reply whose top level is `{ "ui": [...] }` (a `response_format`
  agent, say) — any other JSON object renders as a key/value block;
- the **Generative UI** tool (`render_ui`) — enable it on the agent's Tools
  tab and the model can call it with `{ "blocks": [...] }`.

Forms and choices are live: submitting a form or clicking a choice posts the
answer back into the conversation as the next user message, so a model can
ask for input and continue.

![Generative UI: stats, a chart and a table rendered from a render_ui tool call](/dashboard/runner-generative-ui.png)

![Generative UI: a form the model asked the user to fill in](/dashboard/runner-generative-ui-form.png)

![Generative UI: the confirmation card and choice buttons after the form was submitted](/dashboard/runner-generative-ui-confirmation.png)

While a run executes, the LLM and tool calls stream into the conversation
as they happen — here a `calculate` call answered mid-run:

![The live activity feed during a run, with a tool call already answered](/dashboard/runner-tool-call.png)

<video src="/dashboard/runner-generative-ui.webm" controls muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

```json
[
  { "type": "stats", "items": [
    { "label": "Revenue", "value": "$3.36M", "delta": "+11%", "tone": "positive" },
    { "label": "Deals", "value": "113" }
  ]},
  { "type": "chart", "chart": "bar", "title": "Revenue by region",
    "x": "region", "series": ["revenue"],
    "data": [ { "region": "EMEA", "revenue": 1240000 }, { "region": "APAC", "revenue": 710000 } ] },
  { "type": "form", "title": "Book a follow-up", "submit": "Book call",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "date", "label": "Date", "type": "text", "required": true },
      { "name": "time", "label": "Time", "type": "select", "options": ["09:00", "11:00", "15:00"] }
    ]}
]
```

Block fields: `card {title, body, image_url, footer}`, `stat {label, value,
delta, tone}`, `stats {items}`, `table {columns, rows}`, `chart {chart:
bar|line|area|pie, title, x, series, data}`, `list {title, items, ordered}`,
`progress {label, value}`, `form {title, submit, fields[{name, label, type:
text|textarea|number|select|checkbox, options, placeholder, required}]}`,
`choices {prompt, options}`, `image {url, alt, caption}`, `callout {tone,
title, body}`, `code {language, code}`.

Blocks are rendered as React elements only, never as HTML. An `image` (or a
card's `image_url`) is displayed straight away when it is a `data:image/…`
URL or one of your own app's — an Active Storage blob, say. A URL on any
other host is shown as a button naming that host instead: fetching an image
is a request to whoever serves it, and the model chose the address, so the
person reading the reply decides whether to make it.

Time-series charts on the console's metrics page use the optional
[groupdate](https://github.com/ankane/groupdate) gem when present and
degrade gracefully without it; the React metrics page reads buckets the
API already aggregated and needs nothing extra.

## Ask ActiveAgents

A tool for developing and CI-ing agents, not a production surface. Answering a
question means sending recorded prompts, outputs and evaluation report excerpts
to a model provider, so the page and its API are available in development and
test only. Where it is off there is no nav item, no route and no endpoint —
both `/activeagents/api/dashboard_assistant` actions answer `403`. Turn it on
somewhere else deliberately, or off everywhere:

```ruby
# config/initializers/action_agent.rb
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.assistant_enabled = true   # or false to remove it in development too
end
```

Choose a provider and model, then allow that provider to process your message,
recent conversation history and authorized report excerpts. Configure a provider
credential in Settings first. The assistant uses the host's authentication,
agent scope, execution policy and quota hooks.

Ask which demo questions passed, why an evaluation failed, or describe an agent
to build. Report cards link to recorded evidence and disclose weak checks and
missing provenance. Historical passes cannot establish that current main works.
Compact report references remain available when earlier excerpts are replaced.
Raw recorded exceptions are withheld from assistant evidence because they may
contain credentials; open the authorized report to inspect those details.
Agent drafts open in the builder for review; they are not saved or run by chat.

Conversation state resets on reload. Assistant generations disable framework
traces and provider notifications, and message/history parameters are filtered
before Rails request logging. Provider retention and any host middleware that
records raw HTTP bodies still follow the host's policies. Repository connections, COI execution, Claude Code sessions
and PR checks remain [planned work](/plans/dashboard-assistant/PLAN).

## Metrics

`/activeagents/metrics` answers the question an on-call tab is open for:
is this service healthy right now, and if not, since when. It is laid out
the way an APM overview is — golden signals across the top, one grid of
time series under them, top-N lists down the right — because the point is
to see a change and then find what moved, not to read a table.

Pick a window with the `1h` / `24h` / `7d` control. The window fixes the
bucket size the whole page is drawn at — 60 buckets of a minute, 96 of 15
minutes, 84 of two hours — so the charts stay the same shape whatever the
traffic, and the indicator beside the control says which (`live · 15 min
buckets`, refreshed every 60 seconds).

Five golden signals lead: **Requests** (with requests per minute),
**Latency** (p50, with p95 and p99 under it), **Error rate** (with the
error count and how many were rate-limited), **Tokens** (input and output)
and **Cost** (with cost per request). Each carries a 24-point sparkline of
its own series and a delta against the period of the same length just
before the window — more traffic and falling latency read as success, a
rising error rate as error, volume and spend stay neutral, because a
bigger number is not by itself good or bad.

Six panels plot the window:

| Panel | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Requests | Bars per bucket, stacked by agent, with deploy markers |
| Latency | p50 / p95 / p99 lines, with the incident marker |
| Errors | Bars stacked by error class, with the incident marker |
| Tokens | Input and output lines |
| Cost | Estimated spend per bucket |
| Tool calls | Calls per bucket, errored calls stacked on top |

The right rail ranks what is behind them: **Agents** by requests (with
p95, error rate and cost), **Models** by tokens, **Slowest actions** by
p95, **Tools** by calls (with average duration and error rate) and
**Errors by type** — `429 rate limit`, `timeout`, `tool error`,
`provider 5xx`, `other`, always all five so the shape of a spike is
readable at a glance.

Filter to one agent from the select, or by clicking its row in the Agents
rail; clicking it again clears the filter. Everything narrows together —
signals, charts and rails — so the page never shows a filtered chart next
to an unfiltered tile. The rail keeps listing every agent while a filter
is on, with the active one highlighted, so it stays the way to hop
between them. An `env` chip names the environment most of the window's
traces report.

Two kinds of marker sit on the plots. A **deploy** is an agent version
saved inside the window (`v4 · SupportAgent`, or `instructions v4 ·
SupportAgent` when that version changed the instructions — the deploy a
latency or error shift most often traces back to); at most the three most
recent are drawn, because more than that is a picket fence. An
**incident** is the bucket with the most errors when it is a real spike —
at least five errors and at least twice the window's error rate — labelled
by its dominant error class and the agent that errored most in it.

Empty windows say so (`No traffic yet — run an agent, or point your app's
ActiveAgent telemetry at this workspace`) rather than drawing five flat
lines.

### The metrics API

`GET /api/metrics` is what the page reads, and what to point your own
alerting or reporting at:

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `range` | `1h`, `24h` (default) or `7d` — the window and its bucket size |
| `hours` | A custom window instead, bucketed to about 96 points (`range` then reads `custom`) |
| `agent` | An `agent_class`; every key in the response is scoped to it |
| `sort` | Ranks the per-agent table: `popular`, `longest`, `cost`, `tokens`, `errors` |

The response carries `range`, `bucket_seconds`, `window_minutes`, `agent`
and `environment`, then `totals` (requests, requests per minute, p50 / p95
/ p99 in ms, errors, error rate, tokens in / out / total, cost, cost per
request, tool calls, tool errors, tool error rate), `deltas` against the
previous period (`requests_pct`, `p50_pct`, `error_rate_pt`, `tokens_pct`,
`cost_pct`; null when there is nothing to compare against), `series` (one
entry per bucket, oldest first, zero-filled, each with `ts`, `requests`,
`requests_by_agent`, the three percentiles, `errors`, `errors_by_type`,
`tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `cost`, `tool_calls`, `tool_errors`), the
`agents`, `models`, `actions` and `tools` rails, `errors_by_type` and
`markers`. The earlier keys — `summary`, `hourly_requests`, `by_agent`,
`window_hours`, `sorts`, `sort` — are still there and still mean what they
did, so anything already reading them keeps working.

Percentiles are nearest-rank over each trace's total duration and are
computed in Ruby from one pass over the window, so PostgreSQL and SQLite
return the same numbers; cost is `ModelPricing`'s estimate per trace from
the model on its first LLM span. `ActionAgent::MetricsReport` is the whole
of it if you would rather call it directly.

## Scenario evaluations

An evaluation scores an agent one of two ways. Without scenarios it samples
the agent's recent recorded generations and scores them against rule,
telemetry and LLM-judge criteria. With scenarios it **replays** a list of
user messages you paste in — one fresh run per scenario, per candidate model
— and reports which tasks the agent completes, what the failures have in
common, and what to change. That is how to answer "can this agent do these
new tasks with the tools it has?" and "how does a frontier model compare with
the latest open-weights model on my workload?" without waiting for traffic.

Paste scenarios into the **Scenarios** field of the New Evaluation form, or
through the API (`scenarios_text`, or a `scenarios` array). One message per
line; `# Heading` lines group related tasks so a group can be run on its own;
options after `|` set expectations:

```text
# Open tickets
Which open tickets mention a refund? | tools: find_tickets
Show me all tickets with no assignee
# Change history
Who changed the shipping policy last week? | contains: policy
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tools: a, b` | A passing answer calls at least one of these tools |
| `contains: x, y` | The answer must contain each pattern (substring or regex) |
| `not_contains: x` | The answer must not contain the pattern |
| `key: k` | A stable key, so results line up across re-imports |
| `group: g` | Overrides the heading for this line |

**Compare models** holds the candidates, one removable chip each, and
submits them as a comma-separated list, which the API also accepts. Type to
search the suggestions, and finish a name the list lacks with Enter or a
comma. A bare name infers its provider from the family (`claude-*` →
Anthropic, `gpt-*` → OpenAI, `name:tag` → Ollama); prefix it to be explicit
(`ollama/qwen3:8b`, `openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`). Each
candidate needs credentials the same way an agent run does — the owner's
provider key or the host app's `config/active_agent.yml`.

What the field suggests depends on the scenarios:

- **With scenarios**, each candidate replays them, so the field suggests the
  models of every provider the owner's runs have credentials for, from the
  same catalogs as the agent builder. A model whose name alone would run on
  another provider is offered with its provider in front: `ollama/llama3.2`,
  or `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` for OpenRouter's copy of an
  Anthropic model.
- **Without scenarios**, each candidate selects the generations the agent
  recorded under that model name. A provider usually records its dated id
  (`gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` for a request for `gpt-4o-mini`), so the field
  suggests the names the agent's generations were recorded under
  (`GET /api/agents/:id/recorded_models`).

Adding or clearing the scenarios renames the catalog models already chosen
to match. **Judge model** suggests the models of the provider the judge runs
on, named under the field: the first of Anthropic, OpenAI and OpenRouter
with credentials, else Ollama when the owner configured a host.
`GET /api/evaluations` reports that provider as `judge_provider`, and the
providers runs can use as `model_providers`. A provider whose credentials
cannot be read, such as a stored key that no longer decrypts, is left out of
`model_providers`. When reading one fails before the judge's provider is
found, `judge_provider` is null with `judge_provider_error: true`, and the
field says the credentials could not be read.

Replays and their judge use the credentials of the evaluated agent's owner.
On an agent's page, which requests the list with `agent_id`, both fields
describe that owner's credentials. The Evaluations page describes the
signed-in owner's, which differ only for an agent someone else owns, as the
host's `agent_scope_resolver` can allow. A host adapter
(`ActionAgent.scenario_evaluation_adapter_resolver`) runs a suite with
whatever credentials it chooses, which these fields do not describe.

The catalogs come from `GET /api/provider_models`. When the host app loads
RubyLLM, it appends the chat models that take and return text from
RubyLLM's model registry for the provider (its bundled catalog, or the
host's own model table) after the live or curated list.

A run is queued (`EvaluationRunJob`) and its results land as each replay
finishes. Each replay runs as the evaluation's owner when agents are owned
per user, so a tool scoped to its caller sees that user's rows; a
multi-tenant install replays unattributed unless a host adapter
(`ActionAgent.scenario_evaluation_adapter_resolver`) runs the suite itself. The suite card opens onto the three questions asked of a run, in
that order — is it getting better, which model, what do I fix — and then
the evidence behind them.

**Runs** lists the suite's history, newest first, numbered `#n` from the
oldest so a number keeps naming the same run once the list is capped. A row
carries when the run finished, a pass bar per model, and its delta against
the previous complete run — `+3 passed vs #7`, green when it moved up, red
when it moved down. A run over a different number of scenarios or models
reads `partial run` instead: those two totals are not comparable and a
delta would lie about it. Selecting an older run re-derives everything below —
models, what to fix, the matrix, the drill-downs — so the whole card
describes the run you are reading, while the collapsed header keeps
reporting the latest.

**Models** gives each candidate its pass bar and `k/n`, mean score, mean
latency, input and output tokens, estimated cost, and the faults it hit as
badges (or `[+] no faults`). The model that did best carries an
info-toned `judge's pick` badge — never a green *winner*, because losing a
comparison by one scenario is not a failing grade — and the **verdict**
line under the panel is the rationale for the pick. The panel says who made
it: the judge model, or `rules` when the run was scored without one and the
ranking is pass rate alone.

**What to fix** turns the faults into work. One card per fault, plus one
per instruction change the judge proposed, each naming the scope it speaks
for (`3 scenarios · both models`), the fix it calls for, and the tools
involved — deduplicated to one chip per tool, whatever the number of
scenarios that hit it: the missing tools a scenario expected, the tools
that errored, or the tools the judge suggested adding. When every missing
tool resolves to the same MCP server the card names it (`served by
Playwright`) and says whether this agent has it enabled or merely has it
available, which is usually the whole diagnosis. The action follows from
that: **Enable *server* for *Agent*** deep-links to MCP Services, failing
or suggested tools to Tools, an instruction change to the agent's
instructions — in-app, with the run still open behind it.

**Scenarios** is the matrix: one row per scenario, one column per model,
filtered by group chips or `[ ] failed only`. Each row shows the tools the
scenario expects as chips, and each cell the `[+]`/`[!]` glyph, the score,
the fault, and the tools that model actually called — coloured against the
expectation, so a call that satisfies it reads green, one that errored red
with `✗`, and anything else stays muted (`no tools called` when there were
none). Group rows carry `k/n passed` per model. Opening a row drills into
it: each model's answer, its tool calls, its timing, tokens and cost, and
the diagnosis behind its fault, with `re-run scenario ->` to replay that
one on its own and a `[x] enabled` toggle to keep it out of later runs.

The footer states the run's terms — the judge, the criteria it scored on,
what it cost — and links to `run report ->`: the same self-contained page
`Report#to_html` writes for a CLI run, framed in the dashboard's own theme
so it does not flash white inside a dark console. *Open standalone* opens
the unframed page, which is the copy to archive next to a CI run.
`Delete suite`, on the right, takes the suite and its runs with it.

A scenario passes when the run completed, met its expectations, and scored
at least 0.7 across the evaluation's criteria. Anything else carries exactly
one fault, assigned from the evidence in this order:

| Fault | Meaning | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|
| `run_error` | The replay raised, or the model returned nothing | Credentials, model name, throttling |
| `tool_error` | A tool the agent called returned an error | Fix the tool, or its parameter descriptions |
| `missing_capability` | The agent said no tool covers the task | Add the tool the recommendation names |
| `expected_tool_not_called` | The scenario expects a tool the agent did not call | Enable the tool, or sharpen its description / the instructions |
| `ungrounded_answer` | The agent had tools, called none, and still stated specifics — a count, an id, a date — nothing supplied | Instruct it to answer only from tool results; add the tool that returns this data |
| `forbidden_content` / `missing_content` | A content expectation failed | Instructions, or the tool's output |
| `low_quality` | Criteria scored the answer below 0.7 | Read the answer against the weakest criterion |

`missing_capability`, `expected_tool_not_called` and `ungrounded_answer` are
the faults that turn a pasted list of new tasks into a backlog: they say which
tasks the current toolset cannot reach and what to build. The last two also
tell an honest gap from an invented answer: `expected_tool_not_called` carries
`ungrounded: true` in its evidence when the answer stated specifics no tool
supplied, and `ungrounded_answer` is the same finding for a scenario that
names no expected tool.

The parsing, scoring, diagnosis and report are the framework's
[`ActiveAgent::Evals`](/framework/evaluations); the engine adds the
persistence, the job, the API and the UI. An app can run the same
evaluations against its own agent from Ruby with that module alone.

The API: `POST /api/evaluations` with `scenarios_text`;
`POST /api/evaluations/:id/run` with `group`, `keys[]`, `scenario_ids[]`
and `models[]`; `GET /api/evaluations/:id/runs/:run_id` for the results,
which carry the same `fix_items` the What-to-fix cards are built from,
server resolution included; `GET`/`PUT /api/evaluations/:id/scenarios` to
read or replace the suite; and
`GET /api/evaluations/:id/runs/:run_id/report` for the HTML report, with
`?theme=dark` or `?theme=light` to pin its palette.

## The MCP facade

The dashboard is itself an MCP server: `POST <mount>/mcp` speaks Streamable
HTTP JSON-RPC, authenticated with a dashboard API key (Settings → API Keys)
as a Bearer token. Connect a client with:

```json
{ "type": "http", "url": "https://example.com/activeagents/mcp",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer aa_..." } }
```

`tools/list` offers two kinds of tool:

| Tool | What a call does |
|---|---|
| `run_<slug>` (one per agent the key can reach) | Runs that agent with `{ message }` and returns its answer; a named action marked *expose as tool* is `run_<slug>__<action>` |
| `find_<records>`, `count_<records>`, `get_<record>` (one set per discovered [schema tools](/actions/tools#bounded-reads-over-a-model-schema-tools) class) | Reads the host's records directly, with the tool's own parameter schema, so a client that only needs the rows does not have to ask an agent for them |

Every call runs as **the key's caller** — the key's owner, or whatever
`ActionAgent.agent_actor_resolver` returns for the request — so a schema
tool's `scope` sees the same actor it would inside an agent run, and an
agent's own authorization callbacks decide against the same person. A
boundary violation (an undeclared filter, an id the caller cannot see) comes
back as a tool result with `isError`, the shape an agent's model would get;
a refusal raised by the host's scope or by an agent answers as a JSON-RPC
error (`-32003`), never as an empty, confident result. Direct reads run no
generation, so neither `execution_enabled` nor the execution quota applies to
them. Set `ActionAgent.mcp_schema_tools = false` to keep schema tools
reachable only through agents. `agent://<slug>` resources return each
agent's live scorecard.

## Authentication

**The dashboard has no authentication by default.** Anyone who can reach
the route can read your traces. Before deploying anywhere non-local, set
an authentication method in the initializer:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  # Any proc that authenticates the request — Devise, Rails 8 sessions, basic auth…
  config.authentication_method = ->(controller) do
    controller.authenticate_admin!
  end
end
```

A browser that asks for a dashboard page without a valid session is sent
to `config.sign_in_path` when one is set — your app's sign-in page — and
otherwise shown a minimal session-expired page. API and MCP clients get a
bare 401 either way. `config.sign_out_path` is the endpoint the header's
"Sign out" item POSTs to (with `_method=delete` and the CSRF token); the
engine has no session of its own, so leave it unset to hide the item.

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.authentication_method = ->(controller) { controller.authenticate_admin! }
  config.sign_in_path = "/admin/sign_in"
  config.sign_out_path = "/admin/sign_out"
end
```

Or constrain the mount in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
authenticate :user, ->(u) { u.admin? } do
  mount ActionAgent::Engine => "/activeagents"
end
```

The engine's controllers are their own base class, so your app's session
helpers are not on them. `config.controller_concerns` puts a concern of
yours there for the lambda to call — see
[Extending engine models and controllers](/framework/self-hosted-observability#extending-engine-models-and-controllers).

The local ingest endpoint accepts unauthenticated posts by default (it
receives traces from your own app process on your own machine). If the
mount is reachable from other machines, set `config.ingest_api_key` to
require a Bearer token — see
[Self-Hosted Observability](/framework/self-hosted-observability). In
multi-tenant mode ingest always authenticates per-account keys (see
below).

## Sending traces to a remote endpoint instead

Point telemetry at any compatible receiver — including the hosted
platform — instead of (or in addition to) local storage:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: https://api.activeagents.ai/v1/traces
  api_key: <%= ENV["ACTIVEAGENTS_API_KEY"] %>
```

The wire format is documented in [telemetry.md](./telemetry.md) under
"self-hosting endpoint requirements" — anything that speaks it can feed
or receive these traces.

## Multi-tenant mode (running your own platform)

The engine also supports account-scoped deployments — this is exactly how
the hosted platform runs it:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.multi_tenant = true
  config.account_class = "Account"        # must have a telemetry_api_key column
  config.trace_model_class = "TelemetryTrace" # optional model override
end
```

In multi-tenant mode the ingest API authenticates with
`Authorization: Bearer <account.telemetry_api_key>` and processes traces
asynchronously through `ActionAgent::ProcessTelemetryTracesJob`
(idempotent per trace_id, capped at 100 traces per request). Add an
`increment_telemetry_usage!` method to your account model to hook usage
tracking or rate limiting; it is called once per authenticated trace ingest
request. The evaluation report collector authenticates the same keys but does
not call it: it asks `quota_checker` with `:evaluation_report` and tells
`usage_recorder` of each stored report.

## Relationship to the hosted platform

| | This engine | activeagents.ai (production) |
|---|---|---|
| Intended use | Development, or your own production mount | Managed production |
| Traces + span waterfall | ✓ | ✓ |
| Metrics + per-agent stats | ✓ | ✓ |
| Trace ingest API | ✓ (single tenant, local) | ✓ (multi-tenant, quotas) |
| Agent builder, runs, versions | ✓ | ✓ |
| Conversations, evaluations, scorecards, cost estimates | ✓ built in | ✓ |
| Accounts, plans, billing, managed sandboxes | Yours to operate | ✓ |

One gem, two contexts: it shows your traces while you develop, and the
platform runs the same engine multi-tenant with managed infrastructure. What
the platform adds is the business around it — accounts, plans, billing,
quotas and cloud sandboxes — not a bigger feature set. To run it as a
shared production surface of your own, see
[Self-Hosted Dashboard](/framework/self-hosted-observability).

## Conversation persistence

`actionagent` depends on
[solid_agent](https://github.com/activeagents/solid_agent), so it is already
in your bundle — the Interactions view is built on the contexts, messages and
generations `SolidAgent::HasContext` records, and dashboard runs persist
through it. The concern resolves those by name to solid_agent's own
`AgentContext`, `AgentMessage` and `AgentGeneration` models, so run its
installer once as well:

```bash
rails generate solid_agent:install
rails db:migrate
```

Include the same concern in your own agents to persist their conversations
alongside traces; generation records carry the same `trace_id` for
correlation:

```ruby
class ApplicationAgent < ActiveAgent::Base
  include SolidAgent::HasContext
  has_context contextual: :user
end
```

See [Persistence (SolidAgent)](/solid_agent) for the rest of what that gem
records — the tool exchange, long-term memory, runs and cost.
