# Dev Console (Dashboard Engine)

The dashboard is its own gem. `activeagent` is the framework — agents,
providers, generation, telemetry reporting — and `actionagent` is a mountable
Rails engine that adds the dashboard on top of it: every agent generation
recorded as a trace with a span waterfall, a metrics overview, and the
agent builder, interactions and evaluations alongside them — running
inside your app against your own database while you build. The hosted
[activeagents.ai](https://activeagents.ai) platform mounts the same engine,
so what you see locally in development is what the platform shows (plus the
accounts, plans, billing and managed sandbox infrastructure a hosted
product has to have) once you point telemetry at it. Every platform
workspace starts with a free low-volume trial.

![Dashboard: traces list with expandable span timelines]

## Quick start

The dashboard's models are Active Record models and its runs persist
conversations, so `actionagent` adds `activerecord` and
[solid_agent](/solid_agent) on top of what the framework already pulls in —
neither of which `activeagent` itself requires. Add both gems:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "activeagent"
gem "actionagent"
```

```bash
bundle install
rails generate action_agent:install
rails db:migrate
```

The generator:

- copies three migrations — `active_agent_telemetry_traces` (the trace
  store), `active_agent_dashboard_tables` (agents, runs, versions,
  conversations, evaluations, sandboxes, recordings, keys) and
  `active_agent_evaluation_scenarios` (scenario suites and their per-model
  results; re-run the generator on an existing install to get it); pass
  `--traces_only` for a trace sink alone,
- mounts the engine at `/activeagents`,
- writes `config/initializers/action_agent.rb`.

API keys and provider credentials are encrypted at rest, so run
`rails db:encryption:init` before creating any (or set
`ActionAgent.encrypt_credentials = false` to store them in plain
text — a deliberate downgrade, not a default).

Deploying this beyond your laptop — for a team, or as the trace sink for
a fleet of apps? See
[Self-Hosted Observability](/framework/self-hosted-observability).

Then enable telemetry with local storage in `config/active_agent.yml`:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  local_storage: true
```

That's it. Run any agent and open `/activeagents` — each generation
appears as a trace with prompt/LLM/tool spans, timing, token usage
(input / output / thinking), provider and model. The dashboard's React
bundle ships prebuilt in the `actionagent` gem, so mounting it doesn't ask
your app to run a JavaScript build.

`local_storage: true` writes traces through the engine's trace model, so it
only works in the app that mounts the engine. Without `actionagent`
installed, telemetry logs that it has nowhere to write — apps that only run
agents point telemetry at an `endpoint:` instead (see below).

## What you get

| Page | Path | Contents |
|------|------|----------|
| Ask ActiveAgents | `/activeagents/assistant` | Ask about recorded evaluations and prepare an agent draft for review (development and test only — see below) |
| Agents | `/activeagents` | Your agents with per-agent request, token and error stats; build, edit, version them, and test them as a user in the Run Agent workbench (see below) |
| Traces | `/activeagents/traces` | Every generation: agent + action, status, duration, tokens; expandable span timeline; All/Errors filter; 30s auto-refresh |
| Metrics | `/activeagents/metrics` | The service overview: golden signals, six time series over 1h/24h/7d, and the top agents, models, actions, tools and error types (see below) |
| Interactions | `/activeagents/interactions` | The conversations behind the traces: messages, tool calls, generations |
| Evaluations | `/activeagents/evaluations` | Scored agent outputs, and scenario suites replayed across models (see below) |
| Console | `/activeagents/console/traces` | The same traces and metrics server-rendered, without JavaScript; span waterfall per trace at `/activeagents/console/traces/:id` |
| Ingest API | `POST /activeagents/api/traces` | JSON trace ingestion from other apps and SDKs (`local_storage` writes through the model instead, no HTTP) |

## Testing an agent as a user

Every agent page has a **Run Agent** button. It opens a workbench that works
the agent the way a user would — a conversation, not a one-shot prompt box —
so you can watch what the model is given, change it, and run again.

![Run Agent: a pinned conversation with the live activity feed and the composer](/dashboard/runner-overview.png)

**Add user messages.** Type a message and press Run (or ⌘/Ctrl+Enter). The
run executes under the agent's instructions and the selected action, and the
reply streams into the conversation with the same LLM/tool activity feed the
Interactions view shows. The conversation is *pinned*: the next message is
sent with every user and assistant turn before it, so "and which one grew
fastest?" means what it would mean to a person. Each run is still its own
`AgentRun` with its own trace, which is how Traces and Interactions keep
showing exactly what the model saw.

<video src="/dashboard/runner-messages.webm" controls muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

The workbench follows the dashboard theme:

![Run Agent in dark mode](/dashboard/runner-overview-dark.png)

**Modify the context.** The conversation on the page is the persisted
solid_agent context, and it is editable: hover a turn to **edit** or
**delete** it, use **Add message** to seed a user or assistant turn without
running anything, and **New conversation** to start from an empty context.
The system row shows the composed instructions the run executes under (edit
those on the Instructions tab). Editing a previous question and asking a
follow-up is the quickest way to see how an agent handles a changed history.

![Context editing: the second question rewritten, and the follow-up answering the rewritten history](/dashboard/runner-context-editing.png)

<video src="/dashboard/runner-context.webm" controls muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**Attach files.** Files attached to a message upload with the run through
Active Storage (`AgentRun has_many_attached :attachments`), and reach the
model according to their kind: images as vision input, PDFs as documents,
and text-like files — CSV, Markdown, JSON, plain text — inlined into the
message, with the filename and size in a header the model can cite. The
persisted user message keeps an attachment manifest, so the conversation
shows the thumbnails afterwards. A host app without Active Storage keeps
everything else and answers attachment uploads with a clear 422.

![Attachments: a CSV attached to a message, answered with stats and a chart built from its rows](/dashboard/runner-attachments.png)

![Attachments: an image described by the model, and a PDF summarised into a card](/dashboard/runner-attachments-image.png)

<video src="/dashboard/runner-attachments.webm" controls muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**Generative UI.** An assistant reply can carry UI instead of, or alongside,
prose: cards, stats, tables, charts, lists, progress bars, forms, choice
buttons, images, callouts and code. Three ways in, all rendered by the same
component:

- a fenced ```` ```ui ```` block in a markdown reply whose body is JSON —
  an array of blocks, or `{ "blocks": [...] }`;
- a JSON reply whose top level is `{ "ui": [...] }` (a `response_format`
  agent, say) — any other JSON object renders as a key/value block;
- the **Generative UI** tool (`render_ui`) — enable it on the agent's Tools
  tab and the model can call it with `{ "blocks": [...] }`.

Forms and choices are live: submitting a form or clicking a choice posts the
answer back into the conversation as the next user message, so a model can
ask for input and continue.

![Generative UI: stats, a chart and a table rendered from a render_ui tool call](/dashboard/runner-generative-ui.png)

![Generative UI: a form the model asked the user to fill in](/dashboard/runner-generative-ui-form.png)

![Generative UI: the confirmation card and choice buttons after the form was submitted](/dashboard/runner-generative-ui-confirmation.png)

While a run executes, the LLM and tool calls stream into the conversation
as they happen — here a `calculate` call answered mid-run:

![The live activity feed during a run, with a tool call already answered](/dashboard/runner-tool-call.png)

<video src="/dashboard/runner-generative-ui.webm" controls muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

```json
[
  { "type": "stats", "items": [
    { "label": "Revenue", "value": "$3.36M", "delta": "+11%", "tone": "positive" },
    { "label": "Deals", "value": "113" }
  ]},
  { "type": "chart", "chart": "bar", "title": "Revenue by region",
    "x": "region", "series": ["revenue"],
    "data": [ { "region": "EMEA", "revenue": 1240000 }, { "region": "APAC", "revenue": 710000 } ] },
  { "type": "form", "title": "Book a follow-up", "submit": "Book call",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "date", "label": "Date", "type": "text", "required": true },
      { "name": "time", "label": "Time", "type": "select", "options": ["09:00", "11:00", "15:00"] }
    ]}
]
```

Block fields: `card {title, body, image_url, footer}`, `stat {label, value,
delta, tone}`, `stats {items}`, `table {columns, rows}`, `chart {chart:
bar|line|area|pie, title, x, series, data}`, `list {title, items, ordered}`,
`progress {label, value}`, `form {title, submit, fields[{name, label, type:
text|textarea|number|select|checkbox, options, placeholder, required}]}`,
`choices {prompt, options}`, `image {url, alt, caption}`, `callout {tone,
title, body}`, `code {language, code}`.

Blocks are rendered as React elements only, never as HTML. An `image` (or a
card's `image_url`) is displayed straight away when it is a `data:image/…`
URL or one of your own app's — an Active Storage blob, say. A URL on any
other host is shown as a button naming that host instead: fetching an image
is a request to whoever serves it, and the model chose the address, so the
person reading the reply decides whether to make it.

Time-series charts on the console's metrics page use the optional
[groupdate](https://github.com/ankane/groupdate) gem when present and
degrade gracefully without it; the React metrics page reads buckets the
API already aggregated and needs nothing extra.

## Ask ActiveAgents

A tool for developing and CI-ing agents, not a production surface. Answering a
question means sending recorded prompts, outputs and evaluation report excerpts
to a model provider, so the page and its API are available in development and
test only. Where it is off there is no nav item, no route and no endpoint —
both `/activeagents/api/dashboard_assistant` actions answer `403`. Turn it on
somewhere else deliberately, or off everywhere:

```ruby
# config/initializers/action_agent.rb
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.assistant_enabled = true   # or false to remove it in development too
end
```

Choose a provider and model, then allow that provider to process your message,
recent conversation history and authorized report excerpts. Configure a provider
credential in Settings first. The assistant uses the host's authentication,
agent scope, execution policy and quota hooks.

Ask which demo questions passed, why an evaluation failed, or describe an agent
to build. Report cards link to recorded evidence and disclose weak checks and
missing provenance. Historical passes cannot establish that current main works.
Compact report references remain available when earlier excerpts are replaced.
Raw recorded exceptions are withheld from assistant evidence because they may
contain credentials; open the authorized report to inspect those details.
Agent drafts open in the builder for review; they are not saved or run by chat.

Conversation state resets on reload. Assistant generations disable framework
traces and provider notifications, and message/history parameters are filtered
before Rails request logging. Provider retention and any host middleware that
records raw HTTP bodies still follow the host's policies.

The assistant's configuration endpoint (`GET /api/dashboard_assistant`)
reports whether GitHub and Claude Code are connected, as booleans with no
tokens. The assistant itself isn't told, and it cannot connect them, start a
checkout sandbox or run a Claude Code session; it points you to Settings →
Integrations, where those live (see
[Local checkout sandboxes](#local-checkout-sandboxes)). COI execution and PR
checks remain [planned work](/plans/dashboard-assistant/PLAN).

## Metrics

`/activeagents/metrics` answers the question an on-call tab is open for:
is this service healthy right now, and if not, since when. It is laid out
the way an APM overview is — golden signals across the top, one grid of
time series under them, top-N lists down the right — because the point is
to see a change and then find what moved, not to read a table.

Pick a window with the `1h` / `24h` / `7d` control. The window fixes the
bucket size the whole page is drawn at — 60 buckets of a minute, 96 of 15
minutes, 84 of two hours — so the charts stay the same shape whatever the
traffic, and the indicator beside the control says which (`live · 15 min
buckets`, refreshed every 60 seconds).

Five golden signals lead: **Requests** (with requests per minute),
**Latency** (p50, with p95 and p99 under it), **Error rate** (with the
error count and how many were rate-limited), **Tokens** (input and output)
and **Cost** (with cost per request). Each carries a 24-point sparkline of
its own series and a delta against the period of the same length just
before the window — more traffic and falling latency read as success, a
rising error rate as error, volume and spend stay neutral, because a
bigger number is not by itself good or bad.

Six panels plot the window:

| Panel | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Requests | Bars per bucket, stacked by agent, with deploy markers |
| Latency | p50 / p95 / p99 lines, with the incident marker |
| Errors | Bars stacked by error class, with the incident marker |
| Tokens | Input and output lines |
| Cost | Estimated spend per bucket |
| Tool calls | Calls per bucket, errored calls stacked on top |

The right rail ranks what is behind them: **Agents** by requests (with
p95, error rate and cost), **Models** by tokens, **Slowest actions** by
p95, **Tools** by calls (with average duration and error rate) and
**Errors by type** — `429 rate limit`, `timeout`, `tool error`,
`provider 5xx`, `other`, always all five so the shape of a spike is
readable at a glance.

Filter to one agent from the select, or by clicking its row in the Agents
rail; clicking it again clears the filter. Everything narrows together —
signals, charts and rails — so the page never shows a filtered chart next
to an unfiltered tile. The rail keeps listing every agent while a filter
is on, with the active one highlighted, so it stays the way to hop
between them. An `env` chip names the environment most of the window's
traces report.

Two kinds of marker sit on the plots. A **deploy** is an agent version
saved inside the window (`v4 · SupportAgent`, or `instructions v4 ·
SupportAgent` when that version changed the instructions — the deploy a
latency or error shift most often traces back to); at most the three most
recent are drawn, because more than that is a picket fence. An
**incident** is the bucket with the most errors when it is a real spike —
at least five errors and at least twice the window's error rate — labelled
by its dominant error class and the agent that errored most in it.

Empty windows say so (`No traffic yet — run an agent, or point your app's
ActiveAgent telemetry at this workspace`) rather than drawing five flat
lines.

### The metrics API

`GET /api/metrics` is what the page reads, and what to point your own
alerting or reporting at:

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `range` | `1h`, `24h` (default) or `7d` — the window and its bucket size |
| `hours` | A custom window instead, bucketed to about 96 points (`range` then reads `custom`) |
| `agent` | An `agent_class`; every key in the response is scoped to it |
| `sort` | Ranks the per-agent table: `popular`, `longest`, `cost`, `tokens`, `errors` |

The response carries `range`, `bucket_seconds`, `window_minutes`, `agent`
and `environment`, then `totals` (requests, requests per minute, p50 / p95
/ p99 in ms, errors, error rate, tokens in / out / total, cost, cost per
request, tool calls, tool errors, tool error rate), `deltas` against the
previous period (`requests_pct`, `p50_pct`, `error_rate_pt`, `tokens_pct`,
`cost_pct`; null when there is nothing to compare against), `series` (one
entry per bucket, oldest first, zero-filled, each with `ts`, `requests`,
`requests_by_agent`, the three percentiles, `errors`, `errors_by_type`,
`tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `cost`, `tool_calls`, `tool_errors`), the
`agents`, `models`, `actions` and `tools` rails, `errors_by_type` and
`markers`. The earlier keys — `summary`, `hourly_requests`, `by_agent`,
`window_hours`, `sorts`, `sort` — are still there and still mean what they
did, so anything already reading them keeps working.

Percentiles are nearest-rank over each trace's total duration and are
computed in Ruby from one pass over the window, so PostgreSQL and SQLite
return the same numbers; cost is `ModelPricing`'s estimate per trace from
the model on its first LLM span. `ActionAgent::MetricsReport` is the whole
of it if you would rather call it directly.

## Scenario evaluations

An evaluation scores an agent one of two ways. Without scenarios it samples
the agent's recent recorded generations and scores them against rule,
telemetry and LLM-judge criteria. With scenarios it **replays** a list of
user messages you paste in — one fresh run per scenario, per candidate model
— and reports which tasks the agent completes, what the failures have in
common, and what to change. That is how to answer "can this agent do these
new tasks with the tools it has?" and "how does a frontier model compare with
the latest open-weights model on my workload?" without waiting for traffic.

Paste scenarios into the **Scenarios** field of the New Evaluation form, or
through the API (`scenarios_text`, or a `scenarios` array). One message per
line; `# Heading` lines group related tasks so a group can be run on its own;
options after `|` set expectations:

```text
# Find records
Which gynecologists in Charlotte have scheduling enabled? | tools: find_records
Show me all providers with no license on file
# Blame
Who changed the biography for Dr. AbdelRazek? | contains: AbdelRazek
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tools: a, b` | A passing answer calls at least one of these tools |
| `contains: x, y` | The answer must contain each pattern (substring or regex) |
| `not_contains: x` | The answer must not contain the pattern |
| `key: k` | A stable key, so results line up across re-imports |
| `group: g` | Overrides the heading for this line |

**Compare models** takes the candidates as a comma-separated list. A bare
name infers its provider from the family (`claude-*` → Anthropic, `gpt-*` →
OpenAI, `name:tag` → Ollama); prefix it to be explicit
(`ollama/qwen3:8b`, `openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`). Each
candidate needs credentials the same way an agent run does — the owner's
provider key or the host app's `config/active_agent.yml`.

A run is queued (`EvaluationRunJob`) and its results land as each replay
finishes. Each replay runs as the evaluation's owner when agents are owned
per user, so a tool scoped to its caller sees that user's rows; a
multi-tenant install replays unattributed unless a host adapter
(`ActionAgent.scenario_evaluation_adapter_resolver`) runs the suite itself. The suite card opens onto the three questions asked of a run, in
that order — is it getting better, which model, what do I fix — and then
the evidence behind them.

**Runs** lists the suite's history, newest first, numbered `#n` from the
oldest so a number keeps naming the same run once the list is capped. A row
carries when the run finished, a pass bar per model, and its delta against
the previous complete run — `+3 passed vs #7`, green when it moved up, red
when it moved down. A run over a different number of scenarios or models
reads `partial run` instead: those two totals are not comparable and a
delta would lie about it. Selecting an older run re-derives everything below —
models, what to fix, the matrix, the drill-downs — so the whole card
describes the run you are reading, while the collapsed header keeps
reporting the latest.

**Models** gives each candidate its pass bar and `k/n`, mean score, mean
latency, input and output tokens, estimated cost, and the faults it hit as
badges (or `[+] no faults`). The model that did best carries an
info-toned `judge's pick` badge — never a green *winner*, because losing a
comparison by one scenario is not a failing grade — and the **verdict**
line under the panel is the rationale for the pick. The panel says who made
it: the judge model, or `rules` when the run was scored without one and the
ranking is pass rate alone.

**What to fix** turns the faults into work. One card per fault, plus one
per instruction change the judge proposed, each naming the scope it speaks
for (`3 scenarios · both models`), the fix it calls for, and the tools
involved — deduplicated to one chip per tool, whatever the number of
scenarios that hit it: the missing tools a scenario expected, the tools
that errored, or the tools the judge suggested adding. When every missing
tool resolves to the same MCP server the card names it (`served by
Playwright`) and says whether this agent has it enabled or merely has it
available, which is usually the whole diagnosis. The action follows from
that: **Enable *server* for *Agent*** deep-links to MCP Services, failing
or suggested tools to Tools, an instruction change to the agent's
instructions — in-app, with the run still open behind it.

**Scenarios** is the matrix: one row per scenario, one column per model,
filtered by group chips or `[ ] failed only`. Each row shows the tools the
scenario expects as chips, and each cell the `[+]`/`[!]` glyph, the score,
the fault, and the tools that model actually called — coloured against the
expectation, so a call that satisfies it reads green, one that errored red
with `✗`, and anything else stays muted (`no tools called` when there were
none). Group rows carry `k/n passed` per model. Opening a row drills into
it: each model's answer, its tool calls, its timing, tokens and cost, and
the diagnosis behind its fault, with `re-run scenario ->` to replay that
one on its own and a `[x] enabled` toggle to keep it out of later runs.

The footer states the run's terms — the judge, the criteria it scored on,
what it cost — and links to `run report ->`: the same self-contained page
`Report#to_html` writes for a CLI run, framed in the dashboard's own theme
so it does not flash white inside a dark console. *Open standalone* opens
the unframed page, which is the copy to archive next to a CI run.
`Delete suite`, on the right, takes the suite and its runs with it.

A scenario passes when the run completed, met its expectations, and scored
at least 0.7 across the evaluation's criteria. Anything else carries exactly
one fault, assigned from the evidence in this order:

| Fault | Meaning | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|
| `run_error` | The replay raised, or the model returned nothing | Credentials, model name, throttling |
| `tool_error` | A tool the agent called returned an error | Fix the tool, or its parameter descriptions |
| `missing_capability` | The agent said no tool covers the task | Add the tool the recommendation names |
| `expected_tool_not_called` | The scenario expects a tool the agent did not call | Enable the tool, or sharpen its description / the instructions |
| `ungrounded_answer` | The agent had tools, called none, and still stated specifics — a count, an id, a date — nothing supplied | Instruct it to answer only from tool results; add the tool that returns this data |
| `forbidden_content` / `missing_content` | A content expectation failed | Instructions, or the tool's output |
| `low_quality` | Criteria scored the answer below 0.7 | Read the answer against the weakest criterion |

`missing_capability`, `expected_tool_not_called` and `ungrounded_answer` are
the faults that turn a pasted list of new tasks into a backlog: they say which
tasks the current toolset cannot reach and what to build. The last two also
tell an honest gap from an invented answer: `expected_tool_not_called` carries
`ungrounded: true` in its evidence when the answer stated specifics no tool
supplied, and `ungrounded_answer` is the same finding for a scenario that
names no expected tool.

The parsing, scoring, diagnosis and report are the framework's
[`ActiveAgent::Evals`](/framework/evaluations); the engine adds the
persistence, the job, the API and the UI. An app can run the same
evaluations against its own agent from Ruby with that module alone.

The API: `POST /api/evaluations` with `scenarios_text`;
`POST /api/evaluations/:id/run` with `group`, `keys[]`, `scenario_ids[]`
and `models[]`; `GET /api/evaluations/:id/runs/:run_id` for the results,
which carry the same `fix_items` the What-to-fix cards are built from,
server resolution included; `GET`/`PUT /api/evaluations/:id/scenarios` to
read or replace the suite; and
`GET /api/evaluations/:id/runs/:run_id/report` for the HTML report, with
`?theme=dark` or `?theme=light` to pin its palette.

## The MCP facade

The dashboard is itself an MCP server: `POST <mount>/mcp` speaks Streamable
HTTP JSON-RPC, authenticated with a dashboard API key (Settings → API Keys)
as a Bearer token. Connect a client with:

```json
{ "type": "http", "url": "https://example.com/activeagents/mcp",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer aa_..." } }
```

`tools/list` offers three kinds of tool: the two below, and the dashboard's
[evaluation and telemetry tools](#evaluations-and-telemetry-from-your-coding-harness).

| Tool | What a call does |
|---|---|
| `run_<slug>` (one per agent the key can reach) | Runs that agent with `{ message }` and returns its answer; a named action marked *expose as tool* is `run_<slug>__<action>` |
| `find_<records>`, `count_<records>`, `get_<record>` (one set per discovered [schema tools](/actions/tools#bounded-reads-over-a-model-schema-tools) class) | Reads the host's records directly, with the tool's own parameter schema, so a client that only needs the rows does not have to ask an agent for them |

Every call runs as **the key's caller** — the key's owner, or whatever
`ActionAgent.agent_actor_resolver` returns for the request — so a schema
tool's `scope` sees the same actor it would inside an agent run, and an
agent's own authorization callbacks decide against the same person. A
boundary violation (an undeclared filter, an id the caller cannot see) comes
back as a tool result with `isError`, the shape an agent's model would get;
a refusal raised by the host's scope or by an agent answers as a JSON-RPC
error (`-32003`), never as an empty, confident result. Direct reads run no
generation, so neither `execution_enabled` nor the execution quota applies to
them. Set `ActionAgent.mcp_schema_tools = false` to keep schema tools
reachable only through agents. `agent://<slug>` resources return each
agent's live scorecard.

### Evaluations and telemetry from your coding harness

The facade also serves the dashboard's own evaluation and telemetry tools, so
the coding harness you already use (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …) can edit an
agent in your checkout, run its evaluations, read what failed, and try again.
The harness brings its own model and login; the dashboard only answers the
calls.

| Tool | What a call does |
|---|---|
| `evaluations_list` | Lists the evaluations of the key's agents, newest first, each with its latest run's status and score; `agent` (slug or id) filters to one agent |
| `evaluations_get` | One evaluation: its criteria, its scenarios and its 10 most recent runs |
| `evaluations_run` | Starts a run. Takes the same selection as `POST /api/evaluations/:id/run`: `scenario_ids`, `keys`, `group`, `models` and `sandbox_id`. A scenario suite runs in the background and comes back `pending` with its run id; a sampling evaluation finishes before the call returns |
| `evaluation_runs_get` | One run (the latest by default): status, scores, usage, fix items and per-scenario, per-model results, each naming its telemetry trace when one was recorded. `failed_only` and `limit` narrow the results |
| `evaluation_runs_compare` | Two runs of one evaluation, result by result: fixed, regressed, still failing, added, removed. Defaults to the latest run against the one before it |
| `traces_search` | Summary rows of traces, newest first, filtered by `agent` (class name or dashboard slug), `status` (`error` or `ok`), `service`, `since_minutes`, `min_tokens` and `min_duration_ms`; at most 100 |
| `traces_get` | One trace by id, OpenTelemetry trace id or its first 8 characters: spans, tool calls with their arguments and results, tokens, estimated cost and failed spans |

A typical loop: `evaluations_run`, poll `evaluation_runs_get` until the run is
`complete`, read the fix items and a failing result's trace with
`traces_get`, edit the agent, run again, and check the change with
`evaluation_runs_compare`. Passing `sandbox_id` runs the evaluation against a
checkout sandbox's app tools without editing the agent (see
[checkout sandboxes](#github-connections-and-checkout-sandboxes)).

The tools read what the JSON API reads for the key's owner: evaluations of
the agents the owner can reach, and traces of the owner's tenant (every trace,
in an install that is not multi-tenant). Another owner's evaluation or trace
answers exactly as a nonexistent one does. `evaluations_run` is checked the
way the JSON API checks a run: a scenario suite needs `execution_enabled` and
execution quota, which answer as JSON-RPC errors as they do for `run_<slug>`,
while an observed agent, an unknown id or a sandbox the run cannot use comes
back as a tool result with `isError`. Strings longer than 1,000 characters are
cut and end in `…[truncated: N more characters]`, long lists end in
`[truncated: N more items]`, and the owner's credentials (API key, provider
keys, GitHub token, sandbox runtime tokens) are masked from every result.

These names are a noun family followed by a verb. Schema tools are always
`find_`, `count_` or `get_` plus a model name, and agent tools are
`run_<slug>`, so no host model (a `Trace` or `Evaluation` model included) and
no agent slug can produce one of them. Set `ActionAgent.mcp_dashboard_tools =
false` to leave the facade serving agents and schema tools only.

## GitHub connections and checkout sandboxes

Settings -> **Integrations** connects the owner's GitHub account over OAuth.
The owner then chooses which repositories the workspace may use. Register a
[GitHub OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers) whose callback URL
is `<mount>/api/github_connection/callback` (for example
`https://example.com/activeagents/api/github_connection/callback`), then
configure it:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.github_client_id = Rails.application.credentials.dig(:github, :client_id)
  config.github_client_secret = Rails.application.credentials.dig(:github, :client_secret)
  # Default "repo read:user"; "public_repo read:user" for public checkouts only.
  config.github_oauth_scopes = "repo read:user"
end
```

Unset, both settings fall back to `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
The token is encrypted at rest like a provider key and is never returned to
the browser. The selection only keeps repositories GitHub lists for that
token.

**Start sandbox** on a selected repository creates an `app_runtime` sandbox
session. A sandbox backend (see `ActionAgent.sandbox_backends`) does the
following for that session:

1. Reads `sandbox_session.checkout_spec`, which holds `repository`, `ref`,
   `clone_url`, `username` and `token`, and clones it.
2. Boots the app. If the app mounts this engine, its MCP facade serves the
   app's agents and schema tools.
3. Returns `mcp_url:` (and, when the facade needs one, `mcp_token:`, a
   dashboard API key of the booted app) from `create_sandbox`.

The session is then an MCP server keyed `sandbox:<session_id>`, shown on the
sandbox as `runtime_server_key`. Add that key to an agent's MCP servers, and
runs and evaluations of that agent call the checkout's own tools. The lookup
is scoped to the agent's owner, so one tenant cannot name another tenant's
sandbox.

### Running against a sandbox without editing the agent

A checkout sandbox is where you try a change: boot a branch, perhaps have a
[Claude Code session](#claude-code-sessions) edit an agent's tools there, and
then see how the agent does with them. For that, a single run can use a
sandbox's runtime without the key being saved on the agent. In a scenario
suite, pick it in **Run against sandbox** next to the models field (the
select lists your ready checkout sandboxes). Every replay of that run is
offered the runtime's tools beside the agent's own, and calls them there, as
if the agent listed `sandbox:<session_id>`. The next run, and the agent's
saved `mcp_servers`, are unchanged.

The run records the sandbox it used, and the Runs list, the suite's summary
line and the run report all name it (`against acme/shop@experiment ·
1a2b3c4d`). The API takes the same thing as `sandbox_id`:

| Endpoint | What `sandbox_id` does |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/evaluations/:id/run` | Every replay of this run reaches the sandbox's runtime. The run's `sandbox` (and `selection.sandbox`) is `{ session_id, server_key, repository, repository_ref }` |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/execute`, `POST /api/agents/:id/test` | This runner run reaches it. The run's summary carries `sandbox_id` |

The sandbox must be yours (in your current account, in a multi-tenant
install), an `app_runtime` sandbox, and ready. It must also belong to the
agent's owner, because the runtime is resolved among that owner's sessions,
as a saved key is. Anything else is refused with `422` and a message saying
which (`code: "sandbox_refused"`). A sampling evaluation, which scores
recorded generations rather than running the agent, and a suite a host
adapter replays, cannot run against a sandbox. A queued run whose sandbox has
stopped by the time it starts fails, saying so, rather than replaying without
the tools it was meant to test. The runtime's token is never in a response
or a stored record: runs store only the `sandbox:<session_id>` key.

### Claude Code

Settings -> Integrations also connects **Claude Code**, in one of two ways,
set by `ActionAgent.claude_code_auth`:

- **`:api_key`** (the default). Paste an Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-api03-…`)
  from the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com), or one issued
  through a supported cloud provider. It is stored like a provider key
  (encrypted, write-only, masked in the UI) under the provider name
  `claude_code`, and never offered as an agent provider. A checkout backend
  reads `sandbox_session.runtime_environment`, which is
  `{ "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" => … }`, and gives it to the Claude Code sessions it
  runs in the checkout, and to nothing else: the `:local` backend never puts it
  in the environment of the checkout's setup, manifest or server (see
  [Claude Code sessions](#claude-code-sessions)).
- **`:local_login`**, with the [`:local` backend](#local-checkout-sandboxes)
  only. Sessions run `claude` on the dashboard's machine with that machine's
  own Claude Code login: whatever `claude /login` (or `claude auth login`) set
  up for the dashboard's OS user, in `~/.claude` or the system keychain. The
  dashboard never reads, copies or stores that credential. It only runs
  `claude auth status --json` (at most once a minute) to show whether the
  machine is logged in, and keeps nothing from it but `loggedIn` and the login
  method. No key is asked for. Any other backend refuses Claude Code sessions
  in this mode, since the login cannot leave the machine.

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.sandbox_service = :local
  config.claude_code_auth = :local_login
end
```

::: warning Claude subscription tokens are not accepted
The dashboard does not store a Claude subscription login: the token
`claude setup-token` prints (`sk-ant-oat…`) is refused. Anthropic's
[Claude Code legal and compliance terms](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance.md)
say that products built on Claude should use API key authentication, and that
third-party developers may not collect, store or route requests through
Claude.ai credentials on their users' behalf. Sign-in to a Claude account must
go through Anthropic's own flow, which is what `:local_login` relies on.

A token stored by an earlier version is never handed to a session: the owner
sees Claude Code as needing an API key (`needs_replacing: true` in
`GET /api/provider_keys`) until they paste one. Delete the stored tokens with
`bin/rails action_agent:claude_code:purge_subscription_tokens`.
:::

`GET /api/sandboxes` reports which mode is in use and whether sessions can
run, never a credential:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `claude_code_auth` | `"api_key"` or `"local_login"` |
| `claude_code_connected` | an API key is stored (`api_key`), or this machine is logged in (`local_login`) |
| `claude_code_login` | `{ logged_in, auth_method }`, in `local_login` mode only |
| `code_sessions_supported` | the backend runs sessions, and runs them in this mode |

The dashboard assistant's configuration reports the same under
`connections.claude_code` (`supported`, `connected`, `auth`, `login`).

## Local checkout sandboxes

The engine ships a `:local` sandbox backend, so **Start sandbox** works on a
developer's own machine with no containers. It clones the repository into a
directory under the host app, runs the repository's setup, and boots it as child
processes of the dashboard. Turn it on in the initializer:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.sandbox_service = :local   # or SANDBOX_BACKEND=local
end
```

It needs `git` and `sh` on the dashboard's `PATH`, plus whatever the checkout's
own setup needs (Ruby and Bundler for a Rails app). Claude Code sessions also
need the `claude` CLI, and either an Anthropic API key connected in Settings ->
Integrations or, with `claude_code_auth = :local_login`, the machine's own
Claude Code login (run `claude /login` once as the dashboard's user). See
[Claude Code](#claude-code).

::: warning The local backend runs the owner's code with the dashboard's privileges
The checkout's setup commands, its server and every Claude Code session run as
the dashboard's own OS user, with its filesystem and its network. Environment
sanitizing (below) keeps the dashboard's credentials and database out of their
environment. It does not isolate them: a checkout can read any file that user
can read. Use `:local` on a developer's machine, or on a single-user install
where the person who connects GitHub is the person who runs the dashboard.

It is **off outside development and test** unless you enable it:

```ruby
config.local_sandboxes_enabled = true
```
:::

| Option | Default | What it sets |
|---|---|---|
| `sandbox_service` | `:mock` | The backend: `:mock` (in memory, runs nothing), `:local`, or one registered in `sandbox_backends`. `SANDBOX_BACKEND` overrides it |
| `local_sandboxes_enabled` | unset: on in development and test, off elsewhere | Whether `:local` may run at all |

| `claude_code_max_turns` | `nil` (Claude Code's own default) | `--max-turns` for every session |
| `claude_code_timeout` | `1800` (seconds) | How long a session may run before it is stopped |
| `claude_code_auth` | `:api_key` | How sessions authenticate: the owner's stored API key, or `:local_login` for this machine's own Claude Code login (see [Claude Code](#claude-code)) |

### What a sandbox runs

Each sandbox gets a workspace, `<local_sandbox_root>/<session_id>/`, readable
only by the dashboard's user:

```
app/            the checkout
db/             the sandbox's SQLite databases, when the checkout uses SQLite (see below)
runtime.json    the manifest the checkout wrote (made owner-only, 0600)
state.json      { pid, port, started_at, step_pid, code_sessions: { "<id>" => pid } }
state.lock      what changes to state.json are serialized on
logs/           checkout, setup, manifest, server and claude-<id> logs
claude/         CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR for Claude Code sessions (unused with claude_code_auth = :local_login)
```

Its handle is `local-<session_id>`. Provisioning runs in a background job (a
checkout can take minutes) and does the following, in order:

1. Fetches the ref, one commit deep, into `app/`. The GitHub token is only in
   the environment of that fetch. It never appears on a command line, and it
   is never written to `.git/config`.
2. Reads `.activeagents/sandbox.yml` from the checkout, if there is one, and
   gives the sandbox [databases of its own](#a-database-per-sandbox).
3. Runs each `setup` command.
4. Picks a free port and runs the `manifest` command.
5. Starts the `start` command in its own process group, with its output in
   `logs/server.log`, and records its pid and port in `state.json`.
6. Polls `GET http://127.0.0.1:$PORT<mcp_path>` with
   `Accept: application/json` until it answers `405`, which means the engine
   is mounted and serving (`401` and `200` count too). The answer must come
   from the sandbox's own server: nothing reserves the port between picking
   it and the server binding it, and another process could take it first.
   On Linux the backend checks in `/proc` that the listening socket belongs
   to the server's process group (or to a process carrying the sandbox's
   `ACTION_AGENT_SANDBOX_SESSION_ID`); elsewhere it asks `lsof`. Only where
   neither can say does it send the manifest's token, and then the listener
   must refuse a JSON-RPC `ping` without it (`401`) and accept one with it.

While a step runs, its pid is in `state.json` as `step_pid`, so a terminate
after the dashboard itself died mid-boot still stops it.

Steps 1 to 6 share `local_sandbox_boot_timeout`. If a step fails, runs out of
time, or the server exits, everything the backend started is stopped. The
sandbox then fails with a message that names the step and ends with the last
lines of that step's log. The GitHub token and the Claude Code API key are
scrubbed from that message. When the sandbox is ready, its MCP server
(`sandbox:<session_id>`) is
`http://127.0.0.1:$PORT<mcp_path>`, with the manifest's token.

### `.activeagents/sandbox.yml`

A checkout says how it boots in an optional `.activeagents/sandbox.yml` at its
root. Every key is optional. The example below shows the default `setup`,
`manifest` and `start`, so a Rails app that mounts this engine needs no file
at all:

```yaml
env:        # extra environment for setup, manifest and server (string values)
  RAILS_ENV: development
setup:      # run once after checkout, in order; default: ["bundle install", "bin/rails db:prepare"]
  - bundle install
  - bin/rails db:prepare
manifest: bin/rails action_agent:sandbox:manifest    # default; must write the manifest JSON to $ACTION_AGENT_SANDBOX_MANIFEST
start: bin/rails server -b 127.0.0.1 -p $PORT        # default; must serve on 127.0.0.1:$PORT and keep running
```

- Every command runs with `sh -c` in the checkout root. A setup command must
  exit 0. `start` must keep running.
- Each command's environment is the sanitized dashboard environment, plus
  `PORT`, `ACTION_AGENT_SANDBOX_MANIFEST` (an absolute path inside the
  workspace) and `ACTION_AGENT_SANDBOX_SESSION_ID`, plus the sandbox's
  [database variables](#a-database-per-sandbox), plus the file's `env`.
  The port is picked after setup, when it was last seen free; nothing holds it
  until the server binds it, so a server that finds it taken fails the boot
  rather than being mistaken for the process that took it (step 6).
  `manifest` and `start` get `PORT`; `setup` does not.
- The GitHub token is never in that environment. The Claude Code API key
  isn't either: only Claude Code sessions get it.
- Unknown keys are ignored. A malformed file fails provisioning, and the
  sandbox's error says what is wrong with it.

**Environment sanitizing.** A sandbox never inherits the dashboard's secrets or
its database. The backend starts from the dashboard's environment as it was
before Bundler set it up (`Bundler.with_unbundled_env`), then drops:

- `DATABASE_URL`, any `*_DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `SECRET_KEY_BASE`,
  `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`, `RAILS_ENV`, `RACK_ENV`, `PORT`,
  `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_*`, `BUNDLE_GEMFILE`, `BUNDLE_*`, `RUBYOPT` and
  `RUBYLIB`;
- `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`: the checkout's code does not get the developer's SSH
  agent;
- `BUNDLER_*`, and git's repository-location and config variables:
  `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`,
  `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, `GIT_NAMESPACE`,
  `GIT_PREFIX`, `GIT_QUARANTINE_PATH`, `GIT_CONFIG`, `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`,
  `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`, `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`,
  `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`, `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n` and `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n`. A git hook
  sets some of them, and they would point the checkout's git at the
  dashboard's own repository or configuration;
- the dashboard's own model-provider and Claude Code settings: every
  `ANTHROPIC_*`, `CLAUDE_*`, `CLAUDECODE`, `OPENAI_*`, `OPEN_AI_*`,
  `OPENROUTER_*`, `OPEN_ROUTER_*` and `OLLAMA_*` variable. A dashboard run from
  inside Claude Code exports its own session's variables and an
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. A session that inherited them would join that session,
  and the base URL would send the owner's credential elsewhere. A Claude Code
  session gets exactly the variables the backend sets (below);
- every variable whose name looks like a secret: it contains `SECRET`,
  `TOKEN`, `PASSWORD`, `PASSWD`, `PASSPHRASE`, `API_KEY`, `APIKEY`,
  `PRIVATE_KEY`, `CREDENTIAL`, `ACCESS_KEY` or `WEBHOOK`, or ends in `_KEY`,
  `DSN`, `_PASS`, `_PWD` or `_PAT` (`DB_PASS`, `MYSQL_PWD`, `LOCKBOX_MASTER_KEY`,
  `SENTRY_DSN`, `GITHUB_PAT`; a bare `PASS`, `PWD` or `PAT` counts too);
- every variable whose value holds a URL with credentials in it, whatever its
  name: a password (`redis://:secret@cache:6379`) or a token as the username
  alone (`https://ghp_x@github.com`). Any `user@` in a URL counts.

Everything else is kept: `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `TMPDIR`, proxy and CA
variables, and rbenv, mise and asdf settings. Processes are spawned with
exactly that environment (`unsetenv_others: true`), so nothing else leaks
through. Because `RAILS_ENV` is dropped, a Rails checkout boots in development
unless its `env` sets it. A checkout that needs a key of its own sets it in
`env`, or reads it from its own credentials.

### A database per sandbox

A checkout's `config/database.yml` usually names a fixed development
database. For a checkout of the app you run the dashboard from, that is
*your* development database, and its `db:prepare` would migrate it. So every
sandbox boots on databases of its own, set through the variables Rails
merges over `database.yml`: `DATABASE_URL` for the `primary` database, and
`<NAME>_DATABASE_URL` for any other, as for the `queue` and `cache`
databases Rails 8's Solid Queue and Solid Cache add
(`QUEUE_DATABASE_URL`, `CACHE_DATABASE_URL`).

The backend reads the adapter and database name of each entry in the
checkout's `config/database.yml`, for the environment the checkout boots in
(`RAILS_ENV` from `env`, or `development`):

| Adapter | Each database becomes | When the sandbox is terminated |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlite3` | `sqlite3:<workspace>/db/development.sqlite3` (`development_<name>.sqlite3` for the others) | removed with the workspace |
| `postgresql`, `postgis` | `postgresql:///<database>_sandbox_<first 8 of the session id>` | dropped with the checkout's own `bin/rails db:drop` |
| `mysql2`, `trilogy` | `mysql2:///<database>_sandbox_<first 8 of the session id>` | the same |
| anything else | left as configured, and logged | — |

- The URLs name only the database. Rails merges a URL over the entry, so the
  host, port, user and password stay what `database.yml` or the environment
  (`PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`) say. `PGPASSWORD` is a secret the
  sanitizing drops: use `~/.pgpass`, or set it in `env`.
- A replica (`replica: true`) reads its primary's database. An entry with
  `database_tasks: false` is a database the app does not manage, and is left
  alone. So is one given as a `url:`, which Rails lets no variable override.
- `SKIP_TEST_DATABASE=1` is set too: without it, `db:prepare` in development
  also prepares the test database, which is still yours.
- Claude Code sessions get the same variables, so a `bin/rails db:migrate`
  a session runs lands in the sandbox's database.
- The drop runs after the server has stopped, with the sandbox's
  environment and the URLs the backend recorded when it booted, and is given
  60 seconds. It is best effort: a failed drop is logged and the sandbox goes
  anyway. A boot that fails drops what its setup may have created.
- `database.yml` is never evaluated in the dashboard. Its ERB tags are
  blanked out and the rest is read as plain YAML. When that does not parse,
  the first `adapter:` line is taken as the primary database's. The file is
  read only at `config/database.yml` in the checkout root: an app nested
  deeper sets its own (the SQLite path of this repository's `test/dummy` is
  relative, so already inside the checkout).
- `logs/setup.log` begins with a `# sandbox database:` line for each decision.

To choose a database yourself, set its variable in `env`; whatever `env`
sets is left alone, and never dropped:

```yaml
env:
  DATABASE_URL: postgresql:///shop_experiments
```

**Known limits of the local backend.**

- **Code reloading.** In development, Active Job's default async adapter runs
  jobs inside the web process, and a reloading app holds the reloader while a
  job runs. A checkout boot (up to `local_sandbox_boot_timeout`) or a Claude
  Code session (up to `claude_code_timeout`) can delay code reloading until it
  finishes. Run jobs in a separate worker (Solid Queue, for example) if that
  gets in the way.
- **Filters.** When a checkout's git config defines filter drivers, which a
  session could add, the session's diff is not recorded rather than running
  their commands. The backend's own git commands also run with
  `core.fsmonitor=false` and `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, so a filesystem
  monitor or hook the session set in `.git/config` does not run either.
- **macOS.** Without `/proc`, the backend identifies its processes by their
  start time from `ps` (read in UTC, so a restart under another `TZ` still
  recognizes them), and never signals a pid it cannot identify. A terminate
  that finds such a process still alive keeps the workspace and its
  `state.json`, logs it, and reports the sandbox as not released, so the
  reaper tries again.
- **Processes that leave the group.** Stopping a sandbox signals its process
  groups. A process that calls `setsid` (or otherwise daemonizes) leaves its
  group and is not reached that way. On Linux the backend also stops every
  process whose environment carries the sandbox's
  `ACTION_AGENT_SANDBOX_SESSION_ID`, but one that also rewrote its
  environment (a long process title does) escapes both, and keeps running
  after the sandbox is stopped. Without `/proc`, any process that called
  `setsid` does.

This repository boots its own dummy app this way. Its
[`.activeagents/sandbox.yml`](https://github.com/activeagents/activeagent/blob/main/.activeagents/sandbox.yml)
shows a nested app, and a Gemfile that isn't at the root.

### The manifest task

The manifest tells the backend where the booted app's MCP facade answers and
which bearer token opens it:

```json
{ "mcp_path": "/activeagents/mcp", "mcp_token": "aa_..." }
```

The engine ships `bin/rails action_agent:sandbox:manifest`, so every app that
mounts it has the task. The task finds the engine's mount in the app's routes
and writes the manifest to `$ACTION_AGENT_SANDBOX_MANIFEST`. When that
variable is unset, it prints the manifest instead. The token belongs to a
dashboard API key named "Checkout sandbox runtime", in the checkout's own
database. The first run creates it, and later runs reuse it, so a sandbox
that boots again doesn't add a key. If the engine is not mounted, the task
exits non-zero with
`action_agent:sandbox:manifest: ActionAgent::Engine is not mounted in this app's routes`.

In an app whose API keys belong to an account or user, that key has no owner
and reaches no agents over MCP. In that case, and for an app that isn't Rails,
`manifest` can be any command that writes the JSON. `mcp_path` must start with
`/`, and `mcp_token` is a string or `null`.

### Stopping and reaping

- **Stop** on a sandbox (`DELETE /api/sandboxes/:session_id`) expires it and
  terminates it.
- Terminating sends `SIGTERM` to the server's process group, to a boot step
  still running and to any running Claude Code session. After about 10
  seconds it sends `SIGKILL`, then removes the workspace.
- A pid is signalled only if that workspace's `state.json` recorded it, and
  only while it is still the process recorded there (by its start time). A
  sandbox that is already gone counts as stopped. One whose recorded process
  is alive but cannot be stopped or identified is kept, with its handle, and
  the reaper tries again.
- An `app_runtime` sandbox expires 2 hours after it is created. Other sandbox
  types expire after 15 minutes.

Nothing reaps expired sandboxes on its own. Schedule the reap task:

```bash
bin/rails action_agent:sandbox:reap   # prints "Expired N sandbox session(s)"
```

It expires every session that is past its expiry and still pending,
provisioning, ready or running, and terminates each one through
`ActionAgent::SandboxCleanupJob`. It also retries sessions whose earlier
terminate failed: those that still hold a handle and, for a backend that
derives a sandbox's handle from its session (`:local` does), expired
`app_runtime` sessions with no handle that changed within the last day (at
most 100 per run). A checkout whose boot never recorded a handle may still
have processes, and nothing else records that a terminate of it failed. Run
it from cron, or as a Solid Queue recurring task:

```yaml
# config/recurring.yml
development:
  reap_sandboxes:
    command: "ActionAgent::SandboxCleanupJob.cleanup_expired!"
    schedule: every 5 minutes

production:
  reap_sandboxes:
    command: "ActionAgent::SandboxCleanupJob.cleanup_expired!"
    schedule: every 5 minutes
```

The file Rails and the Solid Queue installer generate is keyed by environment
(it starts with `production:`). Solid Queue reads only the current
environment's key when the file has one, so a top-level `reap_sandboxes:`
never runs there. Add the entry under each environment the file names.

A sandbox runs in its own process groups, so stopping the dashboard doesn't
stop its sandboxes. After a restart, `state.json` is how the dashboard finds
them again. Provisioning, Claude Code sessions and cleanup run as Active Job
jobs, and **Cancel** signals a session from the web process. Run the
dashboard and its job workers on one machine, as one user, so they share the
workspaces.

### Claude Code sessions

When a sandbox is **ready**, its card in Settings → Integrations shows a
Claude Code panel. **Run Claude Code** stays disabled until Claude Code can
run: an Anthropic API key is connected, or, with `claude_code_auth =
:local_login`, this machine's Claude Code is logged in (see
[Claude Code](#claude-code)). Write a prompt, and the dashboard
runs Claude Code headless in the checkout. The **Model** select next to it
picks what the session runs on: *Default (Claude Code's own)* sends no
model, `sonnet`, `opus` and `haiku` are Claude Code's aliases, and *Other…*
takes a full model id (`claude-sonnet-4-5`). The panel remembers the last
choice in this browser. Each session in the list, and the open one, shows
its model. The panel shows each event as it arrives:

- the assistant's text;
- each tool call and its result;
- the final result line, with turns, cost and duration.

When the session finishes, the panel shows the checkout's `git diff`, with new
files included. **Cancel** stops a running session: `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL`
if Claude Code has not exited about 10 seconds later. A cancelled session is
marked cancelled at once, but its events and diff are recorded until Claude
Code has stopped. Its `diff_pending` stays `true` until then, and the panel
keeps polling. A session that never ran (cancelled in the queue, or before
Claude Code started) settles with no diff and `diff_pending: false`.

Only one session runs per sandbox at a time. Each one counts as an execution:
`execution_enabled` must be on, and the execution quota applies. Sessions are
stored in `active_agent_code_sessions`. An existing install gets that table by
running `rails generate action_agent:install` and `rails db:migrate` again.
The API offers the same actions:

- `GET` and `POST /api/sandboxes/:session_id/code_sessions` (`prompt`, and
  an optional `model`);
- `GET …/code_sessions/:id?after=N`, which returns events from index N, and
  the diff once the session has finished;
- `POST …/code_sessions/:id/cancel`.

The `:local` backend runs:

```bash
claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose \
  --permission-mode acceptEdits --no-session-persistence
```

It adds flags as needed:

- `--permission-prompts none` when the installed CLI supports it;
- `--max-turns N` when `claude_code_max_turns` is set;
- `--model M` when the session names a model.

The prompt goes in on standard input, never on the command line. The session
runs in the checkout, in its own process group. Its environment is the
sanitized one, plus:

- with `claude_code_auth = :api_key`, the owner's key as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set to the sandbox's own `claude/` directory;
- with `:local_login`, no credential and no `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: Claude Code
  reads the dashboard user's own configuration and login from `HOME`, which
  the sanitized environment keeps. The dashboard's own `CLAUDE_*` and
  `ANTHROPIC_*` variables are still dropped, so a session never picks up a key
  or a base URL from the dashboard's environment. The user's `~/.claude`
  settings (hooks, MCP servers, permissions) apply to these sessions too;
- `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`, `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING` and
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`, each set to `1`.

A session still running after `claude_code_timeout` is stopped and fails. The
backend scrubs the checkout token and the Claude Code API key from the
recorded events and the diff. A session keeps at most 1,000 events, and a diff
of at most 500 KB.

**Permission mode.** Sessions run in `acceptEdits` mode unless you set
`claude_code_permission_mode`. In that mode, Claude Code may edit files in the
checkout and run filesystem commands. Nobody is there to answer a permission
prompt, so anything else that would ask is denied. `plan` keeps sessions
read-only. Avoid `bypassPermissions`: it lets a session run any command as the
dashboard's user.

## Authentication

**The dashboard has no authentication by default.** Anyone who can reach
the route can read your traces. Before deploying anywhere non-local, set
an authentication method in the initializer:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  # Any proc that authenticates the request — Devise, Rails 8 sessions, basic auth…
  config.authentication_method = ->(controller) do
    controller.authenticate_admin!
  end
end
```

A browser that asks for a dashboard page without a valid session is sent
to `config.sign_in_path` when one is set — your app's sign-in page — and
otherwise shown a minimal session-expired page. API and MCP clients get a
bare 401 either way. `config.sign_out_path` is the endpoint the header's
"Sign out" item POSTs to (with `_method=delete` and the CSRF token); the
engine has no session of its own, so leave it unset to hide the item.

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.authentication_method = ->(controller) { controller.authenticate_admin! }
  config.sign_in_path = "/admin/sign_in"
  config.sign_out_path = "/admin/sign_out"
end
```

Or constrain the mount in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
authenticate :user, ->(u) { u.admin? } do
  mount ActionAgent::Engine => "/activeagents"
end
```

The engine's controllers are their own base class, so your app's session
helpers are not on them. `config.controller_concerns` puts a concern of
yours there for the lambda to call — see
[Extending engine models and controllers](/framework/self-hosted-observability#extending-engine-models-and-controllers).

The local ingest endpoint accepts unauthenticated posts by default (it
receives traces from your own app process on your own machine). If the
mount is reachable from other machines, set `config.ingest_api_key` to
require a Bearer token — see
[Self-Hosted Observability](/framework/self-hosted-observability). In
multi-tenant mode ingest always authenticates per-account keys (see
below).

## Sending traces to a remote endpoint instead

Point telemetry at any compatible receiver — including the hosted
platform — instead of (or in addition to) local storage:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: https://api.activeagents.ai/v1/traces
  api_key: <%= ENV["ACTIVEAGENTS_API_KEY"] %>
```

The wire format is documented in [telemetry.md](./telemetry.md) under
"self-hosting endpoint requirements" — anything that speaks it can feed
or receive these traces.

## Multi-tenant mode (running your own platform)

The engine also supports account-scoped deployments — this is exactly how
the hosted platform runs it:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.multi_tenant = true
  config.account_class = "Account"        # must have a telemetry_api_key column
  config.trace_model_class = "TelemetryTrace" # optional model override
end
```

In multi-tenant mode the ingest API authenticates with
`Authorization: Bearer <account.telemetry_api_key>` and processes traces
asynchronously through `ActionAgent::ProcessTelemetryTracesJob`
(idempotent per trace_id, capped at 100 traces per request). Add an
`increment_telemetry_usage!` method to your account model to hook usage
tracking or rate limiting; it is called once per authenticated trace ingest
request. The evaluation report collector authenticates the same keys but does
not call it: it asks `quota_checker` with `:evaluation_report` and tells
`usage_recorder` of each stored report.

## Relationship to the hosted platform

| | This engine | activeagents.ai (production) |
|---|---|---|
| Intended use | Development, or your own production mount | Managed production |
| Traces + span waterfall | ✓ | ✓ |
| Metrics + per-agent stats | ✓ | ✓ |
| Trace ingest API | ✓ (single tenant, local) | ✓ (multi-tenant, quotas) |
| Agent builder, runs, versions | ✓ | ✓ |
| Conversations, evaluations, scorecards, cost estimates | ✓ built in | ✓ |
| Accounts, plans, billing, managed sandboxes | Yours to operate | ✓ |

One gem, two contexts: it shows your traces while you develop, and the
platform runs the same engine multi-tenant with managed infrastructure. What
the platform adds is the business around it — accounts, plans, billing,
quotas and cloud sandboxes — not a bigger feature set. To run it as a
shared production surface of your own, see
[Self-Hosted Dashboard](/framework/self-hosted-observability).

## Conversation persistence

`actionagent` depends on
[solid_agent](https://github.com/activeagents/solid_agent), so it is already
in your bundle — the Interactions view is built on the contexts, messages and
generations `SolidAgent::HasContext` records, and dashboard runs persist
through it. The concern resolves those by name to solid_agent's own
`AgentContext`, `AgentMessage` and `AgentGeneration` models, so run its
installer once as well:

```bash
rails generate solid_agent:install
rails db:migrate
```

Include the same concern in your own agents to persist their conversations
alongside traces; generation records carry the same `trace_id` for
correlation:

```ruby
class ApplicationAgent < ActiveAgent::Base
  include SolidAgent::HasContext
  has_context contextual: :user
end
```

See [Persistence (SolidAgent)](/solid_agent) for the rest of what that gem
records — the tool exchange, long-term memory, runs and cost.
