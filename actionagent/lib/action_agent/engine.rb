    # engine's files from the host's.

    # engine-level setting scopes that — so an acronym host looks up
    # ActionAgent::API::TracesController and raises NameError even though the
    # autoloader named the module correctly above. No single spelling satisfies
    # both kinds of host: a plain host camelizes to Api, an acronym host to API.
    # So the namespace answers to both. `const_missing` rather than an eager
    # alias because the controllers are autoloaded on demand, and naming them at
    # boot would load the whole dashboard.
    # The router does not consult the autoloader's inflector, so its lookups
    # miss in both directions. An acronym host asks for
    # ActionAgent::API::TracesController while the constant is
    # Api::TracesController: an all-caps run in a missing constant is retried
    # in the spelling default camelization produces (API -> Api). A plain host
    # asks for Api::McpServersController while the constant is
    # MCPServersController (the file is in INFLECTION_OVERRIDES): a missing
    # constant matching an override's default spelling is retried as the
    # acronym constant, via DEFAULT_SPELLINGS — which also keeps caller code
    # written against the pre-acronym names resolving. Only the engine's own
