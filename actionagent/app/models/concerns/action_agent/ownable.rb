module ActionAgent
  # Attaches a dashboard record to whatever the host app calls an owner.
  #
  # Each model names the associations that could own it, most preferred
  # first, and the first one the host app has actually configured wins:
  #
  #   class Agent < ApplicationRecord
  #     include Ownable
  #     owned_by :user, :account
  #   end
  #
  # So an app with users scopes agents per user, an app with only accounts
  # scopes them per account, and a single-user self-hosted install declares
  # neither association and owns everything implicitly. That ordering is
  # per-model on purpose: an app can reasonably keep agents per user while
  # keeping API keys per account, and the platform does exactly that.
  #
  # Both foreign keys exist in the engine's schema either way, so moving a
  # deployment between shapes is a configuration change, not a migration.

      #     request, or a resolver that returned nil. Returning `all` here
