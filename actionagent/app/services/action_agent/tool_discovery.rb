module ActionAgent
  # Builds the dashboard's tool and MCP-server inventory by reading what
  # agents actually called, rather than what someone remembered to register.
  #
  # Four record sources are merged, because each one sees a different slice
  # of the same traffic:
  #
  # * **The offered tool roster** — the tools array in each generation
  #   request, recorded on the prompt span as +prompt.input.tools+ and on
  #   each solid_agent generation as +provenance["tools"]+. The only source
  #   that sees a tool the model was given and never called, and the only
  #   one carrying descriptions and parameter names.
  # * **Telemetry tool spans** — the only source for agents running in a
  #   host app and reporting in over the wire, and where timing and error
  #   rates come from.
  # * **solid_agent generations** (+agent_generations.tool_calls+) — every
  #   tool call the model *requested*, including ones that never produced a
  #   span because the run died first.
  # * **solid_agent messages** (+agent_messages+ with +role: "tool"+) — the
  #   results that came back, which is where a tool's arguments survive even
  #   when telemetry is disabled.
  #
  # Counting a tool once per source would multiply-count a dashboard-executed
  # run, which writes all four. So each source feeds a distinct counter
  # (+calls+, +requested+, +results+) and +calls+ falls back to the largest
  # observed count when telemetry is absent — a self-hosted install with
  # telemetry off still gets real numbers instead of zeros.
  #
  # MCP attribution comes from ActiveAgent::Telemetry::ToolOrigin (the
  # +mcp__server__tool+ convention, tagged onto spans at instrumentation
  # time), then MCPCatalog's hints for bare tool names, then the tool is
  # treated as a method the agent class defines.
  #
  # Scopes are passed in rather than derived, so the caller's ownership
  # rules (single-user, per-user, or multi-tenant) decide what is visible.
  # The same goes for checkout sandbox runtimes: the caller hands in the live
  # ones it may see (SandboxSession.runtime_server_listings), and they are
  # listed beside the catalog under their "sandbox:<session_id>" keys.
