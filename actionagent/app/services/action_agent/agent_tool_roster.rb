module ActionAgent
  # One agent's tool roster, as the agent editor's Tools tab reads it: every
  # tool the agent can be offered and every MCP service it can be given, each
  # carrying what the window actually recorded for it.
  #
  # Three groups, one row vocabulary — the same one the Tools and MCP
  # Services pages use, so a roster reads the way the observability views do:
  #
  # * **Agent-defined** — the tools this agent's own generations offered
  #   (ToolDiscovery's +agent+ origin), plus every schema tool the host
  #   declares, on or off. Two kinds share the group. A *schema tool* — one
  #   a host ActiveAgent::SchemaTools class generates — is offered only while
  #   +agent.tools+ names it: that is the reading AgentToolbox takes at
  #   generation time, and the evaluation runner, dashboard runs and the MCP
  #   facade all follow it. So it is selected here, and switchable, and every
  #   one has a row because any agent may enable any of them
  #   (Agent.available_tools) and a tool switched off has to keep its row to
  #   be switched back on. A tool the agent class declares *in code* is
  #   offered by the class itself; the dashboard reports it and cannot switch
  #   it, so its row is read-only — a checkbox that cannot add or remove the
  #   tool is a control that changes nothing.
  # * **Dashboard** — Agent::AVAILABLE_TOOLS, the capabilities the builder
  #   offers every agent. These are the roster: +agent.tools+ is what
  #   AgentToolbox turns into function schemas at generation time.
  # * **MCP** — never stored on the roster. Computed from the services the
  #   agent enables, which is where they are edited. The services are the
  #   catalog plus the live checkout sandbox runtimes the caller hands in
  #   (+runtimes:+), which an agent enables under their "sandbox:<id>" keys.
  #
  # Enablement reads the agent's own configuration: +tools+ for the dashboard
  # capabilities and the schema tools, +mcp_servers+ for services and their
  # per-server allow-lists (an entry with no +tools+ key offers everything
  # the server serves).
