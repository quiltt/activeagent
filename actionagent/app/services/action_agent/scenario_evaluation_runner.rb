module ActionAgent
  # Runs a scenario evaluation: replays every selected scenario through the
  # agent once per candidate model and writes one EvaluationScenarioResult per
  # scenario × model plus a per-model summary and verdict on the run.
  #
  # The scoring, fault diagnosis and roll-up are ActiveAgent::Evals'; this
  # class supplies what only the dashboard knows — how to run the agent
  # (Agent#test_execute with a model override), where to persist each result,
  # how to price tokens, and which judge model the owner has credentials for.
  #
  # The run's `scores` keep the shape the Evaluations UI renders — criterion
  # => stats, or criterion => { model => stats } when comparing — and add
  # underscore-prefixed summaries:
  #
  #   "_models"          — per model: pass rate, mean score, latency, tokens, cost, fault counts
  #   "_recommendations" — faults grouped across scenarios with the fix each calls for
  #   "_verdict"         — the best model and why (judge-written when a judge is available)
  #   "_selection"       — the scenarios and models this run covered
