module ActionAgent
  # Routes a tool call to the MCP server that serves it.
  #
  # An agent names the servers it uses in +mcp_servers+, and a catalog entry
  # carries the url to reach one over HTTP. A tool the agent's servers claim,
  # and that the agent's entry for that server does not switch off, is called
  # there; anything else returns nil, and the caller falls back to the engine's
  # own AgentToolbox.
  #
  # Only HTTP transports are dispatchable. A stdio server runs as a child
  # process of whatever launched it, so the dashboard has no address to call —
  # those stay listable and attributable without being callable.
  #
  # A single run can also reach a checkout sandbox's app runtime the agent
  # does not name (+extra_server_keys+, "sandbox:<session_id>"): evaluating
  # an agent against a checkout someone is experimenting in, without saving
  # that sandbox on the agent. Such a key is treated as if the agent had it
  # enabled, and resolves exactly as a saved one does: through
  # SandboxSession.runtime_server_entry, among the agent's owner's sessions,
  # and only while it is live. Only runtime keys are taken; a catalog server
  # the agent does not enable stays out of reach.
