    # Authentication is the host app's (ActionAgent
    # .authentication_method), and so is ownership: `owned` scopes any
    # dashboard relation to the signed-in user or account depending on what
    # the model declared with `owned_by`, which is how a single-user
    # install, a per-user install and a multi-tenant platform all read the
    # same controllers.
    #
    # Because it authenticates with the host's session cookie, it keeps the
    # forgery protection ApplicationController turns on: the dashboard sends
    # the page's CSRF token with every mutating request (frontend
    # utils/apiFetch.mjs). Endpoints that authenticate with a bearer token
    # instead — the telemetry ingest endpoint (Api::TracesController), the
    # evaluation report collector (Api::EvaluationReportsController) and the
    # MCP facade (Api::MCPController) — are exempt.
