# Scenario evaluations for agents that answer with tools.
#
# `require "active_agent/evals"` loads this module on its own, without the
# rest of the framework, so an app that calls models some other way (RubyLLM,
# a plain HTTP client) can still run the same evaluations.
#
# The module owns everything about an evaluation except talking to the agent:
# parsing a pasted list of tasks (ScenarioParser) or a YAML suite (Suite),
# resolving candidate models (ModelSpec), scoring an answer against rule
# criteria and the scenario's expectations (Scorer), naming why a scenario
# fell short and what would fix it (Diagnosis, refined by an optional Judge),
# and rolling everything up per model (Report). Runner ties them together
# around one callable you supply: given a scenario and a model, run the
# agent and return a Replay. Correlation is optional plumbing on top: it
# links the traces a run emits back to the result that caused them.
#
#   scenarios = ActiveAgent::Evals::ScenarioParser.scenarios(pasted_text)
#   models    = ActiveAgent::Evals::ModelSpec.parse_all(%w[gpt-5-mini qwen3:8b], default_provider: "openai")

#     scenarios: scenarios,

#     replay: ->(scenario, spec) { my_agent.run(scenario.prompt, model: spec.model, provider: spec.provider) }
