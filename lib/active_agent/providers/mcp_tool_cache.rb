    # Process-local cache for the tools an MCP server advertises.
    #
    # Asking a server what it offers is a round trip, and an expensive one: a
    # hosted server measures ~450ms for `tools/list` on top of ~680ms for the
    # handshake. The answer changes about as often as the server is redeployed,
    # so a generation that pays that to relearn the same 27 tool names is paying
    # it for nothing.
    #
    # With an entry cached, {MCPBridge} needs no connection at all to advertise
    # the tools — it connects only if the model actually calls one. So the cost
    # becomes zero for a generation that never reaches for an MCP tool, and one
    # connection for a generation that does.
    #
    # Entries hold plain data: no sockets, no child processes, no class
    # references. That is what makes it safe to hold across a fork — a child
    # gets a copy-on-write snapshot with nothing in it bound to the parent's
    # file descriptors or threads.
