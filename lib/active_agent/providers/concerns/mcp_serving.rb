    # Serves `mcps:` declarations, natively where a provider's API can and
    # client-side everywhere else.
    #
    # A declaration is passthrough by default: it becomes the provider's own
    # `mcp_servers` parameter, and the provider connects, lists the tools and
    # calls them. That works only where the provider implements MCP, and where it
    # does not the failure is quiet — DeepSeek ignores `mcp_servers`, returns 200,
    # and answers without the server's data, so it reads as a poor answer rather
    # than as a configuration error.
    #
    # The default is therefore inverted here: a provider declares the transports
    # its own API can serve ({#mcp_native_transports}, empty by default) and
    # {MCPBridge} serves the rest, which is what makes `mcps:` work on every
    # provider rather than only the ones that implement it.

    # Each provider may override:
    # - `mcp_native_transports`: the transport kinds its own API can serve
